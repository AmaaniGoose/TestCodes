Hello everyone.

I'm trying to build OpenJ9 using CMake on Windows/MSVC. Big thanks for the job, it seems in general as a working solution, but the following error occurs during the build:

```bash
> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBOOT_JDK=C:\Java\jdk-11.0.8 -C openj9\runtime\cmake\caches\win_x86-64.cmake -G"Ninja" ..
> cmake --build . --target install -j 4
....

Building C object runtime\cfdumper\CMakeFiles\cfdump.dir\main.c.obj
..\runtime\include\vendor_version.h(47): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'openj9_version_info.h': No such file or directory
```

I've looked over the CMake-related files as well as .h ones and never found this header (I believe this is an autogenerated header). But I see the following header file in my build directory: `j9version.h`.  Is this a new reincarnation of `openj9_version_info.h`? One thing confuses me, this file contains a `J9VM_VERSION_STRING` define while users of `openj9_version_info.h` expect J9**J**VM_VERSION_STRING.

What is the difference between those two definitions and where the `openj9_version_info.h` should be or how to generate this one?

Thank you very much, sorry for editing.
