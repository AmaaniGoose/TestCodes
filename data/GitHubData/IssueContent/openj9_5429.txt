Code in the call to `JavaCoreDumpWriter::writeMonitorObject` from the javadump agent passes a stack-local J9VMThread to the `getObjectMonitorOwner ` call:

which the called API: 
https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/2f295ea91cdd97ff37eb5d164fc63014ea718bc7/runtime/util/moninfo.c#L59

uses its `J9VMThread*` in a variety of ways:

This may result in issues when the code attempts to use that J9VMThread as though it was a real thread.
