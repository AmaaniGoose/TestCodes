Enable inlining of the following rotate methods:
```
java_lang_Long_rotateRight
java_lang_Integer_rotateRight
java_lang_Long_rotateLeft
java_lang_Integer_rotateLeft
```
Some investigation will be needed to determine the best way to do this.  x86 and Z do higher-level inlining (see [1]), whereas Power does its own inlining at the backend.  I'm not sure why Power does it differently.  My preference would be for the higher-level inlining unless there's a good reason otherwise.
