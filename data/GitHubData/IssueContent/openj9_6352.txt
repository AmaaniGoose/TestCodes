Each code generator provides its own implementations of `TR::NULLCHK` and `TR::resolveAndNULLCHK` evaluators.  The logic in these evaluators is largely identical, yet implemented independently.  There is a good possibility that much of it can be shared between the backends with specialization points inserted and implemented as necessary.  The logic should be simplified as much as possible, and better documentation should be provided as well.
