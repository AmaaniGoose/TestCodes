Java -version output
--------------------
```
openjdk version "11.0.4" 2019-07-16 
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.4+11) 
Eclipse OpenJ9 VM AdoptOpenJDK (build openj9-0.15.1, JRE 11 Linux amd64-64-Bit Compressed References 20190717_286 (JIT enabled, AOT enabled) 
OpenJ9 - 0f66c6431 
OMR - ec782f26 
JCL - fa49279450 based on jdk-11.0.4+11)
```

There are OpenJ9 1.8 JVMs with the same behaviour, so it seems not to be version specific.

Summary of problem
------------------
Attaching a javaagent to the running JVM via `com.sun.tools.attach.VirtualMachine` results in `ATTACH_ACK` response but the javaagent does not get loaded/started.
A heap dump from the affected JVM does not reveal any of the classes provided by the javaagent's jar file. Restarting the JVM resolves the issue.
From the outside everything looks as expected when attaching the javaagent.

Diagnostic files
----------------

There is no output to the applications stdout/stderr whatsoever.
We now added `-Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.logging=yes` and are waiting for the next occurrence. I will add the log when available.
