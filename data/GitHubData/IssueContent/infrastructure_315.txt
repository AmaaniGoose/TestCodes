This issue has happened previously (see infra issue #145) -  /usr/bin/dockerd (deleted) 
This is causing Docker-based tests to fail (see [openjdk8_hs_externaltest_x86-64_linux/52](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/External%20tests/job/openjdk8_hs_externaltest_x86-64_linux/52/console))

Comment from previous infra issue: 
"Apparently the error fork/exec /usr/bin/dockerd (deleted): no such file or directory can be caused by something deleting and recreating /usr/bin/dockerd whilst it's still running, so that the inode of /usr/bin/dockerd doesn't match the inode of the existing dockerd process."

The quick fix is to restart Docker on the machine.  

The longer term solution is to correct the Ansible scripts to restart Docker after an update occurs (or some similar approach).
