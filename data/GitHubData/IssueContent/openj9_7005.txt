Hello,

I have been using openj9 replacing hotspot, and the services we are running have significantly improved both in terms of memory usage and responsiveness.  Currently, I am facing an issue.
I am running an application with openj9 using following flags.

"-Xminf0.2",
"-Xmaxf0.4",

[According to doc](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYKE2_8.0.0/openj9/xminf/index.html) these flags specifies the minimum and maximum proportion of the heap that must remain free after a global garbage collection cycle.

If the free space is above or below these limits, the OpenJ9 VM attempts to adjust the heap size so that: -Xminf ≤ free space ≤ -Xmaxf.

But it does not seem to shrink enough space after a gc

Am I missing something?
