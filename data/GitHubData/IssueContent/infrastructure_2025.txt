AIX 7.1 TL4 SP4 (or SP8)

- [ ] Missing install
- [ ] Bug in ansible playbook
- [ ] Request for new playbook addition
- [x] Non-reproducible setup of build system

Details:
* These systems were originally installed in June 2017
* The base OS has never been updated since.
* Recently the OSS packages have been updated, but, again, not the base OS.
* Over the years - the have been manual tweaks to the system - undocumented, or poorly documented, in many cases - which implies these systems are not reproducible - cannot be rebuilt into the current setup.

* My proposal is to save the current images (as backup) and to rebuild the systems from scratch.
* Depending on AdoptOpenJDK needs this could still be at AIX 7.1 TL4 SP4 (current in 2017) or continue with AIX 7.1 TL4 but with the latest SP (iirc, SP8)
* These systems would then be further configured using the current playbook (AIX version2 using roles rather than flatfile `aix.yml` -- this should ensure reproducibility of these `build` systems.
* After acceptance of the new builds - delete the saved images as no longer relevant.
