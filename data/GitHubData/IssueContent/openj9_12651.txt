This relocation is only generated when `symbol->isMethod()` is true; therefore there is an implicit assumption that (at least in a relocatable compile) a symbol having `isMethod()` return true implies a load of a method from an entry (presumably the method ref entry) in the constant pool. This is a concern because there are several "method" relocations, there isn't a good reason why `isMethod` just happens to mean `TR_MethodObject`.
