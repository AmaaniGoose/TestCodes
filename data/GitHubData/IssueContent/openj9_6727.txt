While investigating a reported issue of core files not being produced even though supposedly the core hard ulimit was unlimited (waiting on javacore for confirmation), I noticed that [`unlimitCoreFileSize`](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9-omr/blob/v0.15.0-release/port/unix/omrosdump.c#L307) doesn't check the return result (`errno`) for the `getrlimit` and `setrlimit` calls. It would be nice if it did so and printed a warning if those calls failed.
