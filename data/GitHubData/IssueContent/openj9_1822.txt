OpenJ9 has an optimization to not recreate the classfile from the ROMClass if no transformers have been added.  This is present in the Extensions repos[1] and has been contributed to OpenJDK starting in JDK10[2].

We need to add a test case that uses a simple agent with no transformers that calls retransformClasses and ensures that the tracepoints in the code that converts ROMClasses to Classfiles don't fire.

This will let us know if the optimization ever breaks.
