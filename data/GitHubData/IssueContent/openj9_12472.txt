@joransiu suggested a small code improvement in https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/pull/742#discussion_r154816421 to the `asynccheckEvaluator` which can simplify one of the paths:

As per the review comment, the code in `lowerAsyncCheck` will have ensured the memref we compare against will not have a base and an index register. If in case this does happen for whatever reason, the code in `generateSILInstruction` has us taken care of because it will separate the index register:
