Currently, `VMnewEvaluator` in aarch64 codegen does not implement `DualTLH` support and initializes allocated TLH with zero even if `BatchClearTLH` is enabled.
Investigate if support for `DualTLH` and `BatchClearTLH` improves performance on aarch64.

It seems that `allocateZeroedTLHPages(vm, true)` is called on startup of aarch64 VM, so TLH is zero cleared by GC.
