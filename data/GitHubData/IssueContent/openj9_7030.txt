`ifInstanceOfEvaluator` in Power is not currently using the common API `calculateInstanceOfOrCheckCastSequences` to generate the tests, while the `instanceofEvaluator` is using. It lead to some duplicate codes and these evaluators needs refactoring.

In Z, both `VMifInstanceOfEvaluator`[1] and `instanceofEvaluator`[2] will eventually call the common API to generate the tests. It might be an example to follow.
