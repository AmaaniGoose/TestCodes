java/lang/Integer has a static compare function which takes two ints and does something like:
```
if (x < y)
  return -1;
if (x == y)
  return 0;
return 1;
```
We should recognize this method and just compare x and y once and use the condition codes to compute the result (0, 1, -1). I believe there are similar methods for the other primitive integer types. This would probably be a recognized method, a dontInline if codegen supported, and a case in the codegens to handle the specific assembly sequence.
