Hi,

I'm doing a POC with OpenJ9, currently on Hotspot, and if successful then adopt it more widely.

### Issue overview
While running performance tests I've encountered an issue which takes the services down.
The performance test is separated in 2: roughly same parts of the code are executed in both 1st & 2nd part.
The problem always appear at the 2nd part, more than 1h into the test.
Around 10min after 2nd part starts, the `Used class storage` metric (see NR JVM stats attached, green line) goes up.
Shortly after, the service health checks fail and task is taken down.
Surprisingly the 1st part of the test doesn't trigger that metric to go up.

Also, not setting `-Xmcrs125M` allowed the `Used class storage` usage to go up significantly.

Any ideas what is happening in this scenario?  How can I get this under control? 
I am worried a similar situation might happen in PROD causing an outage.

Thank you.

### What I've tried
I had one performance test run with `-Xgcpolicy:balanced` which didn't have the above issue, but added higher latencies. 

### Setup details
Spring Boot 2.4.1 / Reactive stack
Running in AWS ECS on Fargate `v1.4.0`
Base Docker image: `adoptopenjdk:11-jre-openj9`
JDK version: `openj9-0.24.0`, Java version: `11.0.10`
JVM flags: 

- `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=50 -Xmcrs125M -Duser.timezone=UTC -Dreactor.netty.ioWorkerCount=16`
- `OPENJ9_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xscmx100m -verbose:sizes -Xshareclasses:name=openj9_system_scc,cacheDir=/opt/java/.scc,readonly,verbose -Xtune:virtualized`

The SCC has been regenerated previously; so it's not the initial one found in base Docker image.
