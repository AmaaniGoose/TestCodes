We've been having issues with some jdk11, jdk15 openjdk tests on Windows, which look related to running out of native memory. In some cases the JIT crashes, which I expect is due to failing memory allocation. The JIT should handle it more gracefully. See https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues/10650#issuecomment-702237504 for the last occurrence. I expect there is a core in https://140-211-168-230-openstack.osuosl.org/artifactory/ci-eclipse-openj9/Test/Test_openjdk15_j9_sanity.openjdk_x86-64_windows_Nightly/65/openjdk_test_output.tar.gz
