Attempting to get a clean run on special.system tests before turning on at OpenJ9 nightly builds I came across this failure.

Testing completes but there is a hang in collecting failures data due to lack of hd space to create a tar.gz containing diagnostic files.  The part that I find interesting here is it isn't the failed tests diagnostic files that are filling the system.  Its some of the passed job.  In the passed list below there were core files for these tests.

I have a zip with "passed" job content including corefiles just ask.
