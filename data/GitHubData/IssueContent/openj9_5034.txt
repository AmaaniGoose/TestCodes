We can take advantage of GitHub's topics feature [1] to add [2] the Eclipse OpenJ9 to a bunch of topics which will effectively increase awareness of our project for people using the topics feature to search repositories relating to their search term.

Do others think this is a good idea? If so let's come up with a list of topics we can add ourselves to. Here is an initial list:

- compiler
- garbage-collector
- gc
- java
- jit
- jvm
- interpreter
- runtime
- virtual-machine

It doesn't have to be this verbose, we can just pick a few topics. This is just a list we can think about picking from. Interested to hear from others.
