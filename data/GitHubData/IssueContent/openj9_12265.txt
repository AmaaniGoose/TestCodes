#9416 mentions HCR could cause a problem with similar symptoms as were observed because of AOT. More specifically, it would be possible for the defining class of the field to be NULL if the class was redefined after the field was looked up, but before its defining was looked up. Currently, class redefinition should cause `shouldBeInterrupted()` to return `true`. What's unclear is whether `shouldBeInterrupted()` is called at any point where it would prevent the issue described above.
