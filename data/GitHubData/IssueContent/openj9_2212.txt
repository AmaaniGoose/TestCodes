@ashu-mehra raised a great question regarding deprecating options / APIs in OpenJ9 in https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/pull/2196:

> Perhaps time to standardize and document the process for deprecating options/APIs? I think we used to have it earlier before we went open.
Eclipse project has a deprecation policy for APIs which is well documented here.
OpenJDK has also added more clarity on API deprecation in this jep and I guess deprecation policy for OpenJ9 specific Java APIs would follow the same.
But I didn't find any policy for deprecation of VM options.

This issue can serve as a placeholder for the discussions, ideas and links to relevant policies.  Once all the requisite data has been collected, a policy can be pulled together from this info.

Note that there is likely an existing Eclipse foundation policy that we'll need to find and use as a basis.
