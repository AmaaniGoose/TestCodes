In https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues/2263, it was decided to enable container support by default based on the belief that this only modified things in a container:

> Given:
> * it's already enabled in Adopt's docker images, 
> * the start up effect is minimal outside a container, and
> * it's a no-op outside a container,
> 
> I'm onboard with enabling this by default.

When reviewing #2954, I was surprised to see that `omrsysinfo_cgroup_get_enabled_subsystems` includes some cgroup systems are enabled even outside a container.  See the example javacore for a host system:

I'm now wondering if this code should be gated by a call to `omrsysinfo_is_running_in_container()`:

Does anyone have concerns with the current code?  Does this need the `in_container()` check?
