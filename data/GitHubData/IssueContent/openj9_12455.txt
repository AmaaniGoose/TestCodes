Currently both relocations and validations are represented by essentially the same base class `TR_RelocationRecord`. However, because of the code in `TR_RelocationRecord::applyRelocationAtAllOffsets` it means the validations are applied for each offset. However, it doesn't make sense to have offsets for validations; offsets refer to the offset at which a relocation should be done. Therefore, to improve the conceptual integrity of the relo framework, the validation records should be distinct from the relocation records.
