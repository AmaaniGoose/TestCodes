Currently, multiple environment variables need to be set to enable debugging in OpenJ9.

```
export UMA_DO_NOT_OPTIMIZE_CCODE="1"
export VMDEBUG="-g3 -fno-inline -O0"
export VMLINK="-g -O0"
export enable_debug=yes
export enable_optimized=no
export enable_optimize=no
export CXXFLAGS="-O0 -g3"
export CFLAGS="-O0 -g3"
export BUILD_CONFIG=debug
```

It's tedious to keep track of all the environment variables. So, a global environment variable or configure option can be added to set all the required environment variables ... to enable debugging for OpenJ9.
