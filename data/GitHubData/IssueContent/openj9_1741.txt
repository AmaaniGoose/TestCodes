When you use the option `-Xjit:verbose=(compileStart|inlining|compileEnd)` the output can be mixed across compilation threads and it's only by examining pointers (which in theory could overlap) that you can piece together what's happening. The output could be made easier for users to filter out the events that happened on particular threads (even if the various lines are still interleaved in the verbose log output).
