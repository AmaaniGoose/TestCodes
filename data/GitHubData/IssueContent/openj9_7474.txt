Add Java methods `Math.fma` and `StrictMath.fma` into `J9RecognizedMethods`. The fma (fused multiple add) is described as 
>Returns the fused multiply add of the three arguments; that is, returns the exact product of the first two arguments summed with the third argument and then rounded once to the nearest double / float.

Note that there should be two types of `fma`
- `public static double fma(double a, double b, double c)`
- `public static float fma(float a, float b, float c)`
