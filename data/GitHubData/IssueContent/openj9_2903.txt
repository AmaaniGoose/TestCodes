As per [this comment](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/pull/2874#issuecomment-421489788), the current design of `TR_Thunks` and the new and somewhat rushed `TR_J2IVirtualThunkPointer` has them doing too much. Each of these two relocates a constant pool address, after which the code is expected to contain a constant pool index that identifies the method whose J2I thunk must be created.

We should use a separate `TR_ConstantPool` relocation so that these relocations can concern themselves with J2I thunks only. The relocation records themselves can contain the constant pool index, so that it doesn't have to be read from the code. The location for `TR_Thunks` would no longer be meaningful. The location of a `TR_J2IVirtualThunkPointer` should become the location that contains the pointer to the J2I thunk, so that `_offsetToJ2IVirtualThunkPointer` can be eliminated.
