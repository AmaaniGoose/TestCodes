Not sure if these are from compiles or tests or both. Likely multiple issues here.
I guess more accurately, this is the Jenkins RemoteFS dir. The home dir would be cygwin /home/jenkins/ since we connect to these machines using cygwin-ssh.

@acrowthe pointed out this [block](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/test/functional/Java8andUp/src/org/openj9/test/support/resource/Support_Resources.java#L78) of test code which is likely the culprit for the `openj9tr_resources` folders
