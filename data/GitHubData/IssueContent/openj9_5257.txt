There are multiple uses of the `getMethodFromNode` and `getMethodFromBCInfo` routines used throughout eclipse/openj9 and eclipse/omr.

Here are two examples of the definitions. There are more scattered around the omr and openj9 codebases.

These routines all look like duplicates of `OMR::Node::getOwningMethod`. We should refactor these routines into OMR and eliminate the redundancy.
