Apparently, cmake does not distinguish between the shared libraries (all called 'libjvm.so') in the compressedrefs, j9vm and server directories. If it fixes on the one in the compressedrefs (or, presumably, the default) directory, link errors ensue because that version does not have a reference to libdl.so. See https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build/issues/1310 for more detail.

The shared library in the compressedrefs directory doesn't have the same behavior as the other shared libraries of the same name: I propose we change the name of the library that appears in the compressedrefs (or default) directory to avoid this confusion.
