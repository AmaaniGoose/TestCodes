Harmony code is required for certain legacy builds, but not Java 9 or OpenJ9.
Request a configuration parameter, e.g. INCLUDE_HARMONY, which is false by default,
in the cmake build system.
@pshipton FYI
@dnakamura will our cmake build system handle different configurations depending on the Java spec version?
