Any mode with Quote (") characters will not work on STF based tests (e.g. systemtest or jck test). For example, the following build was run with : -Xjit:counts="- - - - - - 1 1 1 1000 250 250 - - - 10000 100000 10000", and it fails:

For any jvm option that contains quote, we need special processing similar to that in https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-systemtest/blob/master/openjdk.build/makefile. We can have a simple make file that only contains quote character processing for mode strings.
