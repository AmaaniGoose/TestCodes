VarHandle has been added as a feature of Java9, to replace Unsafe. 

In openj9, VarHandle is implemented using MethodHandle. In the JIT, we recognize and transform a VarHandle call into an invokeGeneric on a MethodHandle object which is an element of `Varhandle.handleTable`. The invokeGeneric becomes a invokeExact on a MethodHandle after conversion in the trees.

In simplified trees, the call is transformed from
```
call VarHandle.set
   aload VH
```
to
```
acall MethodHandle.asType
   aloadi VarHandle.handleTable[i]
      aload VH
   aload <call site MethodType>
call MethodHandle.invokeExact
   ==>acall MethodHandle.asType
```

As stated in http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/193, users of VarHandle is encouraged to store VarHandle objects into static final fields to allow constant folding to fold away some checks.

> For predictable behaviour and performance at runtime VarHandle instances should be held in static final fields

Currently, our goal is to optimize VarHandle calls on VarHandle instances that are held in static final fields. The following are the main things we need,

- [x] Guarded static final field folding #3018
- [x]  Inline the MethodHandle call chain in targeted inlining
- [ ] Enhanced MethodHandle inlining opt strategy.
- [ ]  Optimization to Unsafe calls made by VarHandle access methods, depends on https://github.com/eclipse/omr/issues/2958

Other optimizations include

- [ ]  Try to replace `acall MethodHandle.asType` with conversion trees for invoke generic. 
   `asType` will create a new MethodHandle for invoke generic, stopping the JIT from targeted inlining.
- [ ]  More optimized java code in VarHandle subclasses.
