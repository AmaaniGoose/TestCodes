When cross compiling for arm from OpenJDK the SPEC variable doesn't have an appropriate value in tr.source/trj9/Makefile, resulting in the JIT being compiled for the host platform instead of the target. As a workaround, forcing SPEC=linux_arm just before the conditional seems to achieve more appropriate behaviour, but this is clearly not the right fix.
I'm not sure how SPEC is supposed to get set in this scenario, so this issue may turn out to be more appropriately raised against openj9-openjdk-jdk9.
