VTs in field and method signatures are represented as Q types. Currently when performing lookups for VTs the MH code uses L types. This results in NoSuchMethodExceptions. We need to modify the `createMethodDescriptorString` helper in MethodType to check for ValueTypes (isPrimitiveClass()) and if so use the Q signature.
