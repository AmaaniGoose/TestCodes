Hi there,

I have an issue sizing the JVM Heap when running in AWS ECS with Fargate Platform 1.4.0. The Fargate platform version is probably relevant because they changed the container runtime to `Containerd`.
Locally on Docker it works as expected.

I'm using the Docker image: `adoptopenjdk:11-jre-openj9`
JDK version: `openj9-0.24.0`, Java version: `11.0.10`
JVM settings: `-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MinRAMPercentage=20 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=30 -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=125M -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch`
ECS Task configuration: overall Task memory to 1GB, however actual memory not set to the container.

Reported JVM Heap size using `-XX:+PrintFlagsFinal` is:
```
[Global flags]
size_t MaxHeapSize = 1968832512 {product} {ergonomic}
uint64_t MaxDirectMemorySize = 1722728448 {product} {ergonomic}
```

Using AdoptOpenJDK Hotspot or OpenJDK builds it works as expected.

Appreciate any help and apologies if this has been reported somewhere else, but I couldn't find any references.
