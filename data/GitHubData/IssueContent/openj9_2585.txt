Dear All,

I'm trying to build OpenJ9 on the PPC SoC equipped with e500v2 core. This core doesn't have the AltiVec IP block (Instead it uses the SPE extension for floating point calculation).

The problem seems to be with the OpenJ9 assumption that all supported cores support AltiVec instructions. One of the assembly tuned files:
./openj9/runtime/compiler/p/runtime/J9PPCCRC32.spp

This is the __crc32_vpmsum [1] optimized implementation of CRC32 calculation for 16B data blocks.

Is there any C implementation of this function available? Or maybe one for SPE assembler?

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that one would need to:

- Rewrite the [1] in C and then allow gcc to optimize it for e500_v2 core 

or 

- Rewrite from scratch the [1] to support SPE assembler instructions instead of altivec

Personally, I would prefer the first option with C, but I'm not sure what would be the performance impact
on OpenJ9.

Has anybody tried to run OpenJ9 on e500_v2? 

Thanks in advance,
