Currently, on the restore run, the translation artifacts (jitConfig->translationArtifacts) are not freed. This is necessary because on the restore run the translation artifacts will have a mix of data from the image as well as data that has been allocated using j9mem_allocate_memory. In order to free memory safely, code would need to be added to check which kind of free should be used.
