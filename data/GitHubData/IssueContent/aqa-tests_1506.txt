Fail rate: 2%

Test sets up a server on a second thread and sends a bunch of data to it. When the server receives the data, it will close the connection, which should cause an IOException on the client side. However if the server start-up thread is slow, the client sometimes finishes sending all of the data before the connection closes (which causes the test to fail).

Looks like a test fix for this went into jdk9 but not 8.
