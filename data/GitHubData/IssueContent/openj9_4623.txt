Unfortunately I accidentally deleted the core file so I did not get a proper backtrace but the assertion is one of a kind in the codebase and I'm certain I can reproduce it. I suspect we'll need additional tracing which I can also provide. I'll go ahead and try to reproduce with a proper backtrace and get a log with `traceRedundantMonitorElimination` unless otherwise told we need additional options.
