To build runtime compressed refs today, I delete the `default` directory and symlink it to the `compressedrefs` directory.

For a real mixed build, we need a single VM directory.

There are several things to consider:

- redirector makes the compressed/full decision based on heap size

In the most basic scenario, the redirector will need to add `-Xcompressedrefs` or `-Xnocompressedrefs` to the command line rather than selecting a VM

- redirector is no longer needed at all

For the purposes of this feature, the redirector could just be deleted. There are other reasons to keep this alive (future VM extensions like the past `-Xaggressive`). Might be nice to make it optional, though that brings its own technical debt.

I suggest that we stick with `default` as the VM directory for mixed. This is consistent with adding future selectable VMs.
