Using #1483 as a reference, RISC-V support needs to be added to the playbook as we have those machines. I thought it'd be best to open an issue to document the changes that need to be made from the original PR, as well as any issues that I will probably run into :-) 

It may be best to look at this once #2100 has been fixed, as using mutli cores to run the playbook should significantly speed it up.
