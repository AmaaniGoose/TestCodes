### Proposed Changes

I would request to enable huge pages on the perf machines. This would enhance our footprint measurements for Open Liberty with Daytrader7. Thanks!

Currently, we just have to machine labelled with `ci.role.perf`: https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/label/ci.role.perf/

### Justification

Please refer to this prerequisite for perf testing: https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/1136.
