For any method with the internal profiling info, we currently cache `best` and `recent` profiling information to the persistent method info [1]. Where in cases there are multiple profiling information available, it will use the best profile info. Current heuristic just replaces the `bestProfileInfo` if recent is non-null. We should replace the best only if the recent has a useful data [2]. Opening up this issue to keep track of the work needed to implement a heuristic to update the best profiling information only when recent has enough data.
