In the GIT_Source role we build and install git from source if the version on the default version of `git` on the machine is either too old or not present.

On some distributions (Such as Debian11) if the distribution's own `git` is new enough but not already present, we don't try to install it and still fall back to compiling it yourself. We should look at this and ensure we use the distribution's `git` where possible.
