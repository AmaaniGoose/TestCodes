Recently, we enabled comment-triggered PR builds https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/2199 (Thanks @Icohedron). There are a couple of enhancements that we would like to add:

- `--sdk_resource` can be a URL. It is the same as `CUSTOMIZED_SDK_URL ` in Grinder that users can provide a URL for downloading SDK. We should use this SDK for testing. We can ignore credentials for now.
```
--sdk_resource=customized --customized_sdk_url=https://xxx
```
- build SDK using github action at https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/build-jdk or https://github.com/eclipse/build-openj9. Users should provide jdk/openj9 repo and branch for now.
```
--sdk_resource=build
```
