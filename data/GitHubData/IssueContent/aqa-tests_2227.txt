If 'all' is specified for PLATFORM:

1. Jobs are generated for platform ppc64-aix_xl, which does not exist
2. Jobs are not generated for x86-32_windows for anything other than jdk8, though it exists for jdk11 and later on hotspot
3. Jobs are not generated for aarch64-linux_xl which exists for jdk11 and later on openj9

Jobs are not generated for other platforms (e.g. RISC-V, Solaris), but I think this is the desired behaviour since they are excluded from the 'normal' test runs).

Also once the jobs are generated the are submitted in the order they were added to the platforms list (in https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/blob/314dc7c35260354d60bf0455c54f9728be7aef12/buildenv/jenkins/openjdk_tests).  It would be nice if the list were sorted once complete so that which jobs are which once they are submitted would be more predictable.
