Currently, there's some jck code in testJobTemplate.

```
if (GROUP == "jck" && JDK_IMPL == "openj9") {
	EXTRA_OPTIONS = "-Xfuture"
	if (JDK_VERSION != "8") {
		EXTRA_OPTIONS += " --enable-preview"
	}
	if (ARCH_OS == "s390x_zos") {
		// zOS has Attach API disabled by default
		EXTRA_OPTIONS += " -Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=yes"
	}
}
```

This issue covers moving that into jck.mk, and any related changes.
