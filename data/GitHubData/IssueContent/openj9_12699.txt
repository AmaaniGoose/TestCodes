As requested by @0xdaryl ,   we should be able to set up a cross-compilated/emulated RISC-V CI testing environment in OpenJ9 for RISC-V before the hardware is attached to the project, which is similar to what was set up at OMR for RISC-V at https://github.com/eclipse/omr/issues/4641.   As @janvrany starts to open OpenJ9 PRs for his work, it would be very useful if we could verify the changes at the project. 

Actually we previously had cross-compiling jobs at Adopt but it won't work any wore. For now, we still have cross-compiling jobs internally which seems working to generate the cross-build (we need to figure out what is still left to do there)

The issue is created to check what is still missing, what has been done and what to do next.
