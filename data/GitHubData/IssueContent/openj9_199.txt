Performance of the Monte Carlo kernel of the SciMark benchmark is reduced by the presence of locking on a local object inside the hot loop. When run with HCR disabled the object is recognised as non-escaping and the lock is folded away, resulting in a 64% performance increase. Folding away the lock with HCR enabled is being investigated.

Test results on 32 core Xeon(R) CPU E7-8867:

OpenJ9 313 Mflops vs Hotspot 753 Mflops

With HCR disabled: 513 Mflops

Analysis of the compilation log suggests that there may be opportunity for further optimisation of the x86 floating point sequences that are being emitted.
