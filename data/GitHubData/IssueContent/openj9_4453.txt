Currently the JIT IL generator generates compressedRefs anchors when running a 64bit JVM in a configuration that uses compressed references to store heap pointers in 32bits rather than 64bit in heap objects. The anchor nodes were originally needed during il generation and optimization to support non-zero heap bases - eg having to add a constant offset to heap pointers. Support for this mode was removed from most of the system some time ago. The compressedRefs anchors are the last holdovers from this. These anchors serve no useful purpose - during code generation we delete all of these anchors and check all of the aloadi and astorei operations to see if they need decompression / compression respectively. This item is to track cleaning up the generation of compressedRef nodes from the IL generator since they are not needed and are simply wasting compile-time and memory
