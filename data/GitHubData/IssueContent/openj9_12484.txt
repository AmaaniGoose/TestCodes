There could be differences between the environment where a snapshot gets created and the environment where the snapshot gets restored and run. 

These differences could be related to:
1) Number of CPUs : affects thread counts in both the JVM (GC and JIT) and potentially the application (e.g. Liberty thread pool) if these are based on initialization done when the snapshot is created
2) Amount of RAM : affects heuristics for how much Java heap the JVM could end up using at run time
3) Locale : a snapshot can be restored in a locale that is different to the one where the snapshot was created, e.g. via something like http://jaredmarkell.com/docker-and-locales/
