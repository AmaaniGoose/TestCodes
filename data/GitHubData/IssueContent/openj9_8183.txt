Known / Suspected Issues:
- [ ] By default the jit gets compiled with `-O0` (this has been patched out for the xlinux and plinux benchmarks)
- [ ] Not all libraries are using split debug info
- [x] Symbol visibility is not properly being handled on gcc, ie all symbols are being marked as public. This will negatively dynamic link time during program startup/ `dlopen()` eclipse/omr#4676 ~
- [ ] We likely aren't building with identical configuration options. Need to compare ddr blobs  to check for diffs
- [ ]  #8314

Platforms with perf >= uma:
- [x] xlinux
- [ ] plinux
- [x] zlinux
- [x] aix
