**Describe the bug**
When building Elasticsearch(v7.6.2), I get an error when using any version of Java under 13. The error below is when I was using Java 11. 

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* Where:
Build file '/elasticsearch/build.gradle' line: 38

* What went wrong:
An exception occurred applying plugin request [id: 'elasticsearch.global-build-info']
> Failed to apply plugin [id 'elasticsearch.global-build-info']
   > The compiler java.home must be set to a JDK installation directory for Java 13 but is [/opt/java/openjdk] corresponding to [11]
```

**To Reproduce**
Build an image of elasticsearch on have version of Java below 13.

`./build_image.sh  elasticsearch 11 hotspot debianslim jdk full`

Then run that image. 

**Expected behavior**
Expected any version of Java to work when building Elasticsearch.

**Additional context**
This might have something to do with the version of Elasticsearch I picked. Trying a lower version might over. We would need to figure out what the cut off would be.
