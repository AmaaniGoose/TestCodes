When a core file occurs on linux, aix, osx systems, the shared libraries are not included in the core. The system libraries are required in order to look at stack traces in the core file. `jextract` gathers all the shared libraries used by a core and compresses them along with the core file for further analysis. When a core file is created in a test run, running jextract on one of them will provide the information required without needing to get access to the machine where the problem occurred.
