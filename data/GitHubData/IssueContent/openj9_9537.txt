@AdamBrousseau PR testing with `depends eclipse/omr#master` shows an incorrect sha. Looking at the top level build https://ci.eclipse.org/openj9/job/PullRequest-OpenJ9/3544/ it shows `OMR: cd259de`, which was the eclipse/openj9-omr openj9 branch head, and not what was actually tested. If you dig into one of the builds https://ci.eclipse.org/openj9/job/Build_JDK8_s390x_linux_Personal/626, you can see it actually built from `HEAD is now at b8634d51d`, which was the head of the master branch at the time.
