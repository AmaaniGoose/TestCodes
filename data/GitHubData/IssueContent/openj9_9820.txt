Currently, for C files on z/OS, we don't actually mark any functions as `inline`. I suspect this is due to the fact that the `inline` keyword is not available in c89. However, given that we now compile with `-Wc,langlvl(extc99)` we should be able to use the `inline` keyword. I have a PR (eclipse/omr#5292) which compiles and passes testing, but I want to do a bit more testing to make sure that there are no unintended side effects.
