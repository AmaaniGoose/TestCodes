Currently, all types use names in classrefs (exception arrays) and signatures in field and method refs. With the introduction of valueTypes, all VTs will use Q signatures in classrefs, however identitytypes will continue to use names. It has been proposed that there might be need for identitytypes to use L signatures in classrefs as well, but this should be enable with an option.
