amd64 code generation contains redundant checks of `TR::Compiler->target.is64Bit()`.  This should be cleaned up, as they're only ever used for 64-bit code generation.

For instance, in `void TR::AMD64JNILinkage::cleanupReturnValue` in `AMD64JNILinkage.cpp`, there are checks like this:

```
op = TR::Compiler->target.is64Bit() ? MOVZXReg8Reg1 : MOVZXReg4Reg1;
```
