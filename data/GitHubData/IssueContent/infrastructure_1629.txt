Hi.

As part of my prep for AIX Playbook v2 #1583 I am looking at the current situation of system `build-osuosl-ppc64-aix-71-1`.

a) does anyone actually look at the mails cronjobs are sending?
```
 384 daemon            Sun Oct 18 00:00  32/1202 "Output from cron job /usr/lo"
 N385 esaadmin          Sun Oct 18 03:01  17/875  "Electronic Service Agent not"
 N386 daemon            Sun Oct 18 05:56  34/1276 "Output from cron job df -k /"
 N387 daemon            Mon Oct 19 00:00  32/1202 "Output from cron job /usr/lo"
```
The jobs 384, 387 (and many earlier ones - everyday at midnight) is failing. Granted, it is an old script,
```#!/usr/bin/ksh
#>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> (C) Copyright IBM Corporation 2008 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<```

And, I can repair it. However, from memory I do not recall this script being part of the playbook.

b) the jobs 385 (ESA agent report) is not relevant and 386 (unmount and mount of /ramdisk) is no longer needed.
I'll just remove both of those. (* consider that done, and the mailq emptied - on this server).

As to this issue:
* where does the script /usr/local/bin/rotate_failedlogin come from originally?
* If not in playbook - how should we address this? Specifically, do playbooks get 'rerun' on a regular basis. This is something that could run as a playbook and 'return' a fact, or maybe better, create/update local.d/facts (or is is facts/local.d).
