Dump.setDumpOptions() did not work when I passed the below option:
    _"java:events=throw,filter=java/lang/NullPointerException#DumpTest.main*,range=1..1"_

After investigation, I found -Xdump:dynamic has to be specified if throw/catch events are configured through Dump.setDumpOptions() when JIT is ON, whereas this option is not required when we set the above option on command line using -Xdump

Documentation for com.ibm.jvm.Dump API needs to be updated.  Also update the user guide as required.
