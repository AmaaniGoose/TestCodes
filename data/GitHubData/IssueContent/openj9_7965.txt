There are two approaches that were brought up in the Portable SCC discussion regarding how to deal with the potential for the compressed refs shift changing with the heap size.

1. Have the JIT assume that the compressed shift might be 4. The generated code then loads the shift value into a register. This load can then be relocated.
2. Fix the shift value to 3 if the JVM is going to use AOT code.
