> Further improvements are needed to get profiling for the "real"
method being called in the invokeprivate case but that will
have to be done in a separate PR.

The right way to do this is to add profiling to the invokePrivateMethod implementation that (re)fetches the receiver class, and then generates a new profile record.

The IProfiler is already able to discard the samples containing the invokePrivateMethod so a second sample would give the JIT the correct information to know the target.
