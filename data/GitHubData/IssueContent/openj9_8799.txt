The `CpuUtilization` class currently uses the `j9sysinfo_get_CPU_utilization` API to extract the CPU utilization times for the entire system, and then uses these utilization times to calculate the CPU load based on the number of active cores.

This is fine, except it does not work on z/OS, where there is no way to extract the CPU utilization times for the entire system. Instead we've delivered the `omrsysinfo_get_CPU_load` as part of eclipse/omr#4702 which returns the instantaneous CPU load for the entire system. On non-z/OS platforms it effectively utilizes the `j9sysinfo_get_CPU_utilization` API and calculates the same value currently computed in `CpuUtilization`, but on z/OS we query a system value which extracts the system CPU load.

We should migrate to using the new API so we can support z/OS.
