**Describe the bug**
Performance tests should run on machines with the `ci.role.perf` label

**To Reproduce**
Run any sanity.perf test

**Expected behavior**
Machines will only schedule on machines with `ci.role.perf` labels in jenkins. 

**Additional context**
I thought we had been using the `ci.role.test&&ci.role.perf` label for performance test suites but from what I can tell we only have [one machine](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/label/ci.role.perf/) with that label now and I can't see any indication in the logs that we're targetting any of the `perf` jobs to machines with that label. I would propose setting up a suitable set of machines with a `ci.role.perf` label which would go on machines that can produce consistent results where possible, and ensure that the `perf` tests only go onto those. I was about to set up some labels before realising they're not currently used.

I think I've mentioned this before but I would also propose using this label INSTEAD of `ci.role.test` and not require `ci.role.test&&ci.role.perf` to be present, to cover any case where we might be using a completely separate machien that we don't want to be used for other general testing.
