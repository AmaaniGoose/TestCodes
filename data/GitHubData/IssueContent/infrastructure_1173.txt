Original issue: https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/1597

Machines:
test-packet-ubuntu1604-x64-2
test-softlayer-ubuntu1604-x64-â€‹1
(There are definitely more but no way of determining unless I ran on every single linux and aix machine)

Hangs on:
```
11:42:34  Wait for initial Pump
11:42:34  Start pumping refuser ...
```

I think there may just be some old processes running on these machines that need clearing out. I don't believe it's a setup problem as `test-packet-ubuntu1604-x64-1` passes the test just fine
