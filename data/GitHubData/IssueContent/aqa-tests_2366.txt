There is an increasing requirement to auto exclude openjdk specific test (.java) by issue_comment, which can be done in a similar way to `auto exclude testCaseName( target)`. The point is excluding  per testcase, which has a smaller size of the granularity than testCaseName. 

One  scenario example would be:

1. Issue opened for specific tests https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/2360 ( could be more than one problematic testcase in one issue)
2. Investigation and comments show the testcase can be excluded 
3. Comment according to some pattern which provides affected jdk_version, impl, platform
4. Comment trigger workflow checkout the openjdk-tests repo and update the right problemlist*.txt file(files) and create the exclude PR
5. update workflow status to the issue so people interested in this could be notified the PR update.

We can do like this not sure if it's helpful or if it's necessary to enable this feature. FYI @lumpfish @andrew-m-leonard @adamfarley
