So far, we have static Docker containers with Alpine Linux 3.11 and 3.12 for testing purposes. Alpine Linux 3.13 was released last January, so it's about time that we add a container for testing with Alpine Linux 3.13.

## Steps to Perform

### Step 1: Add a Dockerfile with Alpine Linux 3.13

The Dockerfiles reside in `https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure/tree/master/ansible/playbooks/AdoptOpenJDK_Unix_Playbook/roles/DockerStatic/Dockerfiles`. You can use the one [for Alpine Linux 3.11](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure/blob/master/ansible/playbooks/AdoptOpenJDK_Unix_Playbook/roles/DockerStatic/Dockerfiles/Dockerfile.alp311) as an example.

### Step 2: Register the Dockerfile in the Ansible playbooks

The container won't magically appear on a machine. It has to be registered in our Ansible playbooks so that during the next machine re-configuration the container is added to the machine and started. To do so, you have to make two changes.

Add the newly created container to this block which is responsible for building the containers:
 
https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure/blob/6362d8ce258aebded8b33a1c7764b10ef915afa4/ansible/playbooks/AdoptOpenJDK_Unix_Playbook/roles/DockerStatic/tasks/main.yml#L28-L37

Add another block similar to this one that starts the container:

https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure/blob/6362d8ce258aebded8b33a1c7764b10ef915afa4/ansible/playbooks/AdoptOpenJDK_Unix_Playbook/roles/DockerStatic/tasks/main.yml#L79-L82

Here, you have to make a couple of changes:

* Pick a free SSH port on the host machine. The old block is using 2229 (`2229:22`). Take the next free number. At the time of writing, this would be 2230.
* Update the name of the container accordingly. It should be `<dockerfile suffix>.<portnumber>`. If the Dockerfile suffix is alp313 and the port number 2230, that would result in `alp313.2230`.
* Update the image name. The format is `aqa_<dockerfile suffix>`. If the Dockerfile suffix is alp313, the result would be `aqa_alp313`.

### Step 3: Test whether your container is good

* [ ] You can log into it via SSH.
* [ ] You can copy a file into it with SCP.
* [ ] The timezone is set to UTC.
* [ ] The Locale (environment variables `LANG`, `LANGUAGE`, `LC_ALL`) is set to `en_US.UTF-8`.
* [ ] You can run our test suite successfully.

To run a part of our test suite, perform the following steps within the container:

1. Download AdoptOpenJDK for Alpine Linux from https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot.
2. Unpack it and set the root folder of the unpacked JDK as `TEST_JDK_HOME`, for example `export TEST_JDK_HOME=/home/jenkins/jdk-16+36`.
3. Configure the BUILD_LIST: `export BUILD_LIST=system`
4. Run the test:
   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests.git
   $ cd openjdk-tests
   $ ./get.sh
   $ cd TKG
   $ make compile
   $ make _sanity.system
   ```
