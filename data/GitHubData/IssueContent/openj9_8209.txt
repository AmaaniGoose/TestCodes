The current behavior of PR builds is overly restrictive: you can only request a build for a particular version and specification if it is implied by 'all'. For example, one should be able to request
```
Jenkins test sanity xlinuxjit jdk13
```
without the response being:
```
Warning: Selected Java versions (13) for x86-64_linux_jit is not supported(nothing to do)!
```
