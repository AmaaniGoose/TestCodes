Spotted by @sxa , Microsoft offers Vagrant boxes at https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/

Some preliminary testing has show that it's fairly easy to retrieve the box and boot the Vagrant box by doing the following:
```
wget https://az792536.vo.msecnd.net/vms/VMBuild_20190311/Vagrant/MSEdge/MSEdge.Win10.Vagrant.zip
unzip MSEdge.Win10.Vagrant.zip
vagrant box add --name windows10 'MSEdge - Win10.box'

# Change in the Vagrantfile:
# adoptopenjdkW2012.vm.box = "mwrock/Windows2012R2"  --> adoptopenjdkW2012.vm.box = "windows10"

vagrant up
```
Some small changes will need to be made to `VPC` to let this run, as the box doesn't have a `vagrant` user and the password is `Passw0rd!` , not `vagrant`.
