As noted by @andrewcraik the `javac` compiler that comes with the Java 9 JDK will generate a method handle sequence for a chained StringBuilder append sequence. We should investigate how the new sequence looks like in Java 9 and what changes are needed to the StringBuilderTransformer [1] optimization to make it functional again.
