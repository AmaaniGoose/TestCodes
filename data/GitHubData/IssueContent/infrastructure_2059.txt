Please set the title to indicate the test name and machine name where known.

To make it easy for the infrastructure team to repeat and diagnose, please
answer the following questions:

- test suite/name? JDK16 OpenJ9 extended.functional suite
- Is there an existing issue elsewhere covering this? Not to my knowledge
- Which machine(s) does it work on? It has not failed fatally on aix72-2, build-2, ibm-2, or on this machine previously 
- Which machine(s) does it fail on? test-osuosl-aix72-ppc64-1
- Do you have a link to a Grinder re-run if the test with the failure? https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/job/Test_openjdk16_j9_extended.functional_ppc64_aix/40/ was the failure and it can be re-run from there

Any other details: Potential out of disk space issue. As I write this i freed up some space in the jenkins home directory which may have released it to get to the failure state. I haven't looked at the log, but just noting this for whoever picks it up. The time on the machine is currently 0447 and a 3Gb core file was present in /tmp which was created at 2009 yesterday (The test took 8h44 so the core likely came from the test. It may be a simple out of disk space issue in the jenkins home dir that caused this, but we should verify.

FYI to anyone who might be looking at results @smlambert @andrew-m-leonard - I'll re-run it on the same machine at https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/job/Test_openjdk16_j9_extended.functional_ppc64_aix/41/
