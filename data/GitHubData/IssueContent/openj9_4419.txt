`protectedWriteThreadsWithNativeStacks` should be re-enabled on OSX once the **omrintrospect** library is properly supported on OSX. In https://github.com/eclipse/omr/issues/3507, **Task 1** (https://github.com/eclipse/omr/pull/3478) and **Task 2** (https://github.com/eclipse/omr/issues/3505) should be finished before re-enabling `protectedWriteThreadsWithNativeStacks` on OSX.

`protectedWriteThreadsWithNativeStacks` is disabled in OpenJ9-OSX via https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/pull/4402.
