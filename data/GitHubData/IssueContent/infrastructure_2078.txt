I need to request a new machine:

- New machine operating system One CentOS, one Ubuntu
- New machine architecture: aarch64
- Provider (leave blank if it does not matter): Equinix
- Desired usage: test and dockerBuild
- Any unusual specification/setup required: Machines are already resetved so just need to be installed and set up
- How many of them are required: 3 (Although I'll start with 2 :-) ) 160 core (2 socket) 3GHz Ampere Altra

Please explain what this machine is needed for: Replacement of previous ThunderX and D05 servers.

NOTE: There is a current issue with Ubuntu 20.04 systems that may cause reboot failures. To avoid the problem, run the following sequence of commands ([taken from here](https://gist.github.com/vielmetti/dafb5128ef7535c218f6d963c5bc624e)) after deploying the OS
```
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install grub2-common
$ grub-install --bootloader-id=ubuntu
Installing for arm64-efi platform.
Installation finished. No error reported.
