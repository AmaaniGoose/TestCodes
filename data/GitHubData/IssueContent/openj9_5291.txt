Currently in codegen checkcast evaluator only supports inline evaluation for
constant cast classes. If the cast class is not known at compile time a VM
helper call is generated. This is true for X, and should also be true on P/Z, as 
up until now we do not generate checkcast nodes where the cast class child
is dynamic.

With upcoming optimizer changes where certain
instanceOf nodes are transformed into checkcast with dynamic cast class,
there is a need to support the inline evaluation for these new cases. 

The X support is implemented in https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/pull/5176
We now need P/Z codegen to inspect their respective evaluator code and 
implement the support if it has not been implemented.
