Very often in Service, we have received system core files from customers without the native libraries, and we have to go back to customer asking them to do jextract again. 

The jextracted files can be huge (and often a few gb) and it is not easy for customer to upload the huge file.  If jextract provides a special option (such as "-excludeCore") to exclude the system core file from the jextract result, then the jextract file normally only a few mb. This would make it much easier for customers to upload the jextract result.

If the system core file is excluded from the jextract result, it would be better if we can add a text file which document the system core file filename, target system info (something similar to the output from Jdmpview command "info sys").  This will avoid confusions.

Of course, this new option should be off by default.  And this option is to be used only after we have had the un-jextracted system core file from customer.  Unfortunately this scenario is very often in service world.
