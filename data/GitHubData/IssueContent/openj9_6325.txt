For performance considerations, investigate and implement a dynamic polymorphic inline cache (PIC) solution for interface dispatches.  Exploit the capabilities and work around the limitations of the AArch64 architecture in the solution.

Extend the solution to include PIC slots that can be initialized at compile-time via profiling information.

As a bonus, consider architecting the solution to this as the basis for a common, cross-platform interface PIC solution where the implementation is written largely in C++ and can be specialized by each architecture.
