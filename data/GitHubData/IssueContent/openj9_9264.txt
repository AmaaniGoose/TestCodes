### JVM Option: -Xnosigint 

`-Xnosigint` is undocumented. It looks like ... it was added for development/test support in `IBM-J9 JCL`. `IBM-J9 JCL` no longer uses the custom implementation of `sun.misc.Signal`, and relies on the default implementation. So, `-Xnosigint` won't work anymore since the custom implementation of `sun.misc.Signal` was removed. Since it is undocumented, no customer should be using `-Xnosigint`. Can `-Xnosigint` be removed?

### Java System Properties: "ibm.signalhandling.*"

With the removal of the custom `sun.misc.Signal` implementation, I also feel that the following Java system properties should no longer be used in `IBM-J9 JCL`:

1. `ibm.signalhandling.sigchain`
2. `ibm.signalhandling.sigint`
3. `ibm.signalhandling.rs`

It looks like ... these were explicitly added to pass information from the JVM to JCL code. Since these system properties are undocumented, no customers should rely upon them.

Can we remove the below code from J9 if the above Java system properties are no longer used in `IBM-J9 JCL`?

### Concerns

There were concerns about IBM customers relying upon the above options.

A counter argument for the above concern would be ... no customers should use or rely upon them since the above options are undocumented.
