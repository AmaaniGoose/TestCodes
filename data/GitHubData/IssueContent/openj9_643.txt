Currently the OpenJ9 VM can not support both compressed references and not compressed references for 64 bit JVMs at the same time.  This means to create a JDK that supports both you need to have 2 JVMs which significantly increases the footprint of the JDK package, the complexity of creating the JDK and the time it takes to create the JDK.

I am creating this Issue to start the conversation about what needs to be completed to make compressed references a runtime decision such that the JVM supports both at the same time.
