This issue is to track the optimization of unbacked ByteBuffer processing in GCM.

The issue originated in my discussion with @keithc-ca [here](https://github.com/ibmruntimes/openj9-openjdk-jdk/pull/266#discussion_r559732681). In Summary, ByteBuffers can be either backed or not backed by an array (indirect buffers vs direct buffers). Currently, the only way to send data from Java to OpenSSL (which is how GCM is currently implemented in OpenJ9) is by converting the ByteBuffer to a byte array. Hence, when a ByteBuffer is not backed by an array, a new array has to be allocated and the data is copied to it. This sacrifices performance.
