**üëæ Description of the issue**

We need to remove systemtest's dependency on `wget` and use `curl` on all platforms. 

Except for system tests, all other tests have been switched to use curl, since we cannot use wget on z/OS and we do not want to support both curl and wget, we choose to use curl only (ref: https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/1250). 

**Tips to solve this particular issue:** 

To fix this issue, we need to update [top.xml](https://github.com/adoptium/STF/blob/master/stf.build/include/top.xml) Ant script and do the following: 
- Remove [check-for-wget](https://github.com/adoptium/STF/blob/master/stf.build/include/top.xml#L366) target and all its references;
- Remove any existing condition from [check-for-curl](https://github.com/adoptium/STF/blob/master/stf.build/include/top.xml#L377) - so that it runs on all platforms; 
- Since we are using a single download tool, we may replace the target `check-for-download-tool` with the target `check-for-curl`;
- Remove conditional property [download-tool](https://github.com/adoptium/STF/blob/master/stf.build/include/top.xml#L377) and use `curl` directly where download-tool was being used;
- Remove any additional conditional properties, such as [download-tool-security-options](https://github.com/adoptium/STF/blob/c1687efe376b077a733766da1f82d2df51e953a6/stf.build/include/top.xml#L396),  and [download-tool-srcfile-option](https://github.com/adoptium/STF/blob/c1687efe376b077a733766da1f82d2df51e953a6/stf.build/include/top.xml#L400) and use the option for `curl` directly in the actual download [command](https://github.com/adoptium/STF/blob/c1687efe376b077a733766da1f82d2df51e953a6/stf.build/include/top.xml#L422);  
- Test the changes in your branch by pointing a Grinder to it and running a system test (e.g. `MathLoadTest_autosimd_0`) on all platforms.
