The current tests we have for the getConstantPool JVMTI method are outdated, and in https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/runtime/tests/jvmtitests/src/com/ibm/jvmti/tests/getConstantPool/gcp001.c the code is all ifdef'd out.

The tests need to be updated to work with the current test framework since there are now use cases that exercise the JVMTI api such as https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues/7591.
