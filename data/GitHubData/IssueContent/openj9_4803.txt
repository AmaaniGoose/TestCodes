This is the general plan as discussed with @mstoodle and @jdmpapin :

1. Move the platform specific (but mostly common) code out from the various `J9AheadOfTimeCompile.cpp` files and into the common `J9AheadOfTimeCompile.cpp`.
2. Use `TR_RelocationRecord` (or more specifically, the appropriate sub types) to write the relocation data into the buffer that gets written out to the SCC.
3. Remove the (again per platform but common) tables of sizes of Relocation Record Binary Templates. Given that the virtual function `bytesInHeaderAndPayload` returns exactly the data in the tables, perhaps there's a way of having only canonical method of getting this information.
4. Move the various Relocation Record Binary Template definitions back into RelocationRecord.cpp.

The plan is to do this one relocation record at a time in order to both simplify the code review process as well as testing.
