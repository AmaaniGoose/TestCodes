I'm trying to fix the `xlpTests` test on Mac, to run properly and pass. ATM it prints the following, doesn't test any large pages, and passes.
```
[2020-12-04T04:07:35.529Z] Runner couldn't determine underlying OS. Got OS Name:mac os x
[2020-12-04T04:07:35.529Z] WARNING: Failed to determine underlying OS. This test needs to know underlying OS.
```

After adding Mac into the list of platforms, I've run into a snag. The OMR port library for Mac hard codes 3 page sizes into the supported page size table.

1) 4k
2) 0 (zero) with flags OMRPORT_VMEM_PAGE_FLAG_SUPERPAGE_ANY
3) #if defined(VM_FLAGS_SUPERPAGE_SIZE_2MB) - which it is - 2m

The problem is that the `-verbose:sizes` implementation stops when it finds the 0 entry and doesn't include the `2m` entry in the output. https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/runtime/gc_verbose_java/VerboseJava.cpp#L307

However, when the user specifies a large page size, it's validated via vmem_find_valid_page_size() which iterates using the flags field and finds 2m to be a valid size.
