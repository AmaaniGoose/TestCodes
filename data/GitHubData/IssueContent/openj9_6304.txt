Fieldwatch tests were recently added here: https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/pull/6257. Unfortunately we were not able to add tests for _Large Heap_ variant JVMs. Additionally, the PR tests don't test on all 32-bit platforms. This issue is to discuss how/if we can test those platforms and what work is required.
