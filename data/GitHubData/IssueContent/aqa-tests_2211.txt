I have a personal build [Test_openjdk16_j9_sanity.system_x86-64_linux_Personal/5](https://hyc-runtimes-jenkins.swg-devops.com/job/Test_openjdk16_j9_sanity.system_x86-64_linux_Personal/5) which failed to complete. In order to find the downstream jobs, I need to click on"`Console Output`" => go to the bottom of the log => click the links inside the console output log [1]. It would be more convenient if the downstream job links exist in the build description page. Could the links to the downstream jobs be added to the build description page?
