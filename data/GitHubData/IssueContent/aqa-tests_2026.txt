Current external tests are supposed to run with dockers, which lets people focus on setting up test running rather than correctly configuring machines.

There is an increasing requirement to run the tests on local or native environment without docker installed. 
For example:

- running tests on mac or windows.
- running directly against pre-build jdk (no docker image available) , could use EXTRA_DOCKER_ARGS to set jdk as default java. Need to double check if it still work.
