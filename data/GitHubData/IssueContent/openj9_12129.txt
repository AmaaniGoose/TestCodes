Received a recent customer problem where they had `-Xmx` == `-Xmnx`. This should not be allowed and a check should be included to prevent this scenario from occurring. 

As taken from @dmitripivkine testing, setting `-Xmx` and `-Xmnx`
```
$ ../temp/jdk-11.0.10+9/bin/java -Xmx4g -Xmnx4g -version
openjdk version "11.0.10" 2021-01-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9-202101291824)

```

and testing `-Xmx` and `-Xmn`
```
$ ../temp/jdk-11.0.10+9/bin/java -Xmx4g -Xmn4g -version
JVMJ9GC019E -Xmn too large for -Xmx
JVMJ9VM015W Initialization error for library j9gc29(2): Failed to initialize
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
```

There is no check for the `-Xmnx` case while there is a check for the `-Xmn` case. A check should be added for the `-Xmnx` case  (something similar to the check to the `-Xmn` case)

This case should also be reflected to the documentation for future reference
