There is a number of messages about unreleased malloc'ed memory segments from JIT in run with -Xcheck:memory. Would you please check that non of them might be a reason for memory leak?

There are some of them:
MethodMetaData.c:149 (mapTable in TR_StackMapTable())
CompilationThread.cpp:758 (_activeThreadName in CompilationInfoPerThread())
CompilationThread.cpp:759 (_suspendedThreadName in CompilationInfoPerThread())
rossa.cpp:1264 (codeCacheManager in initializePersistentMemory())

Also there are a few allocations from RawAllocator.hpp:71 which I did not track to the consumer.

An ultimate goal is cleanup code to eliminate these messages. Currently it prevents to run tests with -Xcheck:memory with JIT enabled modes.
