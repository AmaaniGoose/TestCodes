I tried to follow this inside openj9 repo:
https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/test/docs/OpenJ9TestUserGuide.md
Then I found this:
https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/wiki/Reproducing-Test-Failures-Locally
which I think is more detailed and works better (clones AdoptOpenJDK repo).

Could we consolidate these two documents?
