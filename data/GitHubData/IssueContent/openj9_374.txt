If the JIT is build in debug mode the JIT will put asserts in the global new and delete operators. This is done to enforce appropriate memory management in the JIT where we must use the correct allocators since we are hosted inside of a runtime environment. Unfortunately, these global operators are being exported from the JIT dll and new and delete operator calls in the JCL native libraries cause asserts to fire the VM to fail to even start. The fix for this is to try and limit the visibility of these modified global new and delete operators in some way - preventing their export or stripping the symbols from the DLL come to mind as potential solutions.
