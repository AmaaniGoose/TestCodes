Issue to track enabling AOT w/ SVM on 32-bit x86. As I find and fix problems, I'll update it here so that others working on 32-bit enablement on other platforms can save themselves the pain of figuring out these issues on their own.

Progress:
- Compile run seems OK.
- Load run is still failing, probably because of some other missed relocations.

Known issues:
1. 32-bit section of `J9::X86::AheadOfTimeCompile::_relocationTargetTypeToHeaderSizeMap` needs to be updated.
2. `genInitObjectHeader` in `x/codegen/J9TreeEvaluator.cpp` needs to be updated to pass in the `TR_ClassPointer` reloKind when not using 64-bit classes.
