TKG runs test targets and [summarizes them at the end of the test run](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/test/TestConfig/scripts/testKitGen/resultsSummary/resultsSum.pl#L139).

We will add a final test at the end of a TKG run that checks if more than zero test targets were run (total of pass+fail > 0, we will have to decide if we should also include skipped), if so, this test passes.  If not, this test fails and will report the test run as failed.

This should address #4834 (and alerted us immediately to the problem noted in #4851).
