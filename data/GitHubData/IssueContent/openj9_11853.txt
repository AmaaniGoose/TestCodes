I am trying this instruction, but got a few errors reported. 
Firstly, for following instruction: I would guess it's trying to point to the path of tracegen, while current build of openj9 has tracegen under $JAVA_BASE/vm/runtime.
```
export J9SRC=$JAVA_BASE/vm
```
Secondly, when I do the make , I got following error: Looks like it failed to find the j9cfg.h from $JAVA_BASE/vm/runtime. Not sure what's the best way to make it found ?
