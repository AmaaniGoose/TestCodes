Why is Power the only platform to define the stackwalker macro `J9SW_JIT_FLOATS_PASSED_AS_DOUBLES`?   I understand the effect in the stackwalker when it's defined (or at least I think I do), but it's not clear to me what the Power JIT is doing that's different from the other architectures that requires it to be defined.

Any insight is appreciated.  It will probably turn out to be a "duh!" moment for me.  :-)
