This is a list of objects that are enqueued for finalization, but are not finalized yet.

If (a new) GC occurs before they are finalized, they have to be kept alive. Hence this list is treated as hard root.

Currently we scan this list single threaded, but in theory it could be parallel (we need to split the list in multiple sublists).

Additionally, a couple of collectors (like Scavenger and CopyForwardScheme) seem to enforce this single threaded operation via sync point, what is overkill since it could be done with HANDLE_NEXT_WORK_UNIT (what actually default RootScanner does).
