Hooks section in javacore contains statistical information of usage of each hook. Currently it looks like:
```
2HKEVENTID     66
3HKCALLCOUNT       245618
3HKLAST            Last Callback
4HKCALLSITE           /tmp/bld_371101/bld_aix_ppc-64_cmprssptrs/compiler/../compiler/trj9/control/HookedByTheJit.cpp:7136
4HKSTARTTIME          Start Time: 2019-01-26T16:19:45.707
4HKDURATION           DurationMs: 0
3HKLONGST          Longest Callback
4HKCALLSITE           /tmp/bld_371101/bld_aix_ppc-64_cmprssptrs/compiler/../compiler/trj9/control/HookedByTheJit.cpp:7136
4HKSTARTTIME          Start Time: 2019-01-24T18:53:04.792
4HKDURATION           DurationMs: 22
```
There are a few improvements we can do:
- Add name of hook in verbose form (currently it is a number `EVENTID     66`)
This name might be used for Snap traces as well

- Currently we are providing stats for last/longest callbacks. It would be very valuable to add average time spent in callback (should we add stats for each subscriber?)

- Current time measuring unit is ms. I believe we should use lower time granulation when possible.
