This is partially for my own notes, but need to be looked at, and may also be covered elsewhere. Looks like the DDR stuff (not too surprising) will need some work

- In [OpenJ9 extended.functional](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/sxa-arm64test/job/Test_openjdk11_j9_extended.functional_aarch64_linux/): `testDDR*` `cmdLineTester` and `jit_hw_2` fail
- Similar in [sanity.functional](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/sxa-arm64test/job/Test_openjdk15_j9_sanity.functional_aarch64_linux/) with `cmdLineTester` tests
- Intermittent failures in [JDK8/J9 sanity.openjdk](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/sxa-arm64test/job/Test_openjdk8_j9_sanity.openjdk_aarch64_linux/)
- [JDK11/J9 extended.system](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/sxa-arm64test/job/Test_openjdk11_j9_extended.system_aarch64_linux/) possibly fails on packet host `-2` and not `-1` - unrelated to docker?
- [JDK11/J9 sanity.system](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/sxa-arm64test/job/Test_openjdk11_j9_sanity.system_aarch64_linux_xl/) TestIBMJlmFRemoteMemoryAuth_0 fails
- [JDK15/J9 extended.system](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/sxa-arm64test/job/Test_openjdk15_j9_extended.system_aarch64_linux_xl/) HCRLateAttachWorkload_previewEnabled_0 fails

Other's (on initial look - not too deep!) seem ok


Memo to self - how to check for RAM/CPU limits in a container:
- CPU: `wc -l /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct/cgroup.procs` (Not accurate)
- RAM: expr `cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes / 1024 / 1024 / 1024` (Or divide by `1073741824`)
- Show stats: `while true; do clear && uptime && docker stats --no-stream; sleep 60; done`
