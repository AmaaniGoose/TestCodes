JNI check should verify that incoming UTF-8 strings are validly encoded, similar to:
https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/875226b3db8cc5cdbcf0ca5f73419e800d7963ed/runtime/vm/jnimisc.cpp#L239-L261
Two things should be checked:

- is the encoding valid at all?
- is the encoding in its most compact form?

One we're in the VM, we assume that UTF data is correct and canonical, which allows the VM to use a byte-for-byte comparision of UTF strings.

Once complete, we should consider deleting the verify/compact code from `FindClass`.
