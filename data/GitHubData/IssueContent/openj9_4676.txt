Currently, these stats reside in privateJITConfig, which is global. Ideally, we want to store AOT stats on the server per-client.
This can be achieved  by either moving AOT stats out of privateJITConfig into its own cache,
or by making privateJITConfig itself per-client.
The latter is probably better, as jit config contains other fields that should be stored per-client.
