This issue is to encapsulate the requirements and work needed to replace our existing Jenkins server with a new one:

Existing Jenkins server is suffering from some instability.  Recent difficult updates have shown that we need a better disaster recovery plan (this is also related to: https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure/issues/1295)  It is also a ubuntu-16.04 machine.  For all of these reasons, and likely reasons not yet listed, we should begin the work to replace the existing Jenkins server with a new one.

Requirements:
- Similar requirements to existing server
- Ansible playbook for creation/spinup
- Staging server to try out upgrades and major features or changes
- Clearly documented process for deploying updates
- Back up / disaster recovery process (in place and tested) / training for multiple people in multiple timezones to be able to assist
- Policy & documentation for how many jobs to keep in history, how many days to keep jobs
- How many of them are required: 1

Please explain what this machine is needed for: 
- nightly/weekly/release builds and testing
- Grinders for debugging and triage
- building tools and dependencies
- building Docker images
- building installers

Considerations:
- Given that this server is for our production builds, should we limit freeform builds, personal duplicates of existing pipelines, etc.?
- Should we have a separate sandbox for 'experimental' jobs and work?
- We should have a script that checks for jobs that have not been run/used in X months to remove old/stale jobs (may not need if all jobs have policy for how many days to keep jobs)
- Consider pushing artifacts to artifactory or other storage so that they are available for longer than
