With the merge of https://github.com/ibmruntimes/openj9-openjdk-jdk9/pull/88 it should now be possible to build for armhf, possibly with something similar to the yml that I use for travis.ci on my fork:

https://github.com/JamesKingdon/openj9-openjdk-jdk9/blob/arm/.travis.yml

What's the right way of doing this within OpenJ9, or would this be better done under AdoptOpenJDK?

If possible I'd like to get arm building and running tests regularly so that we can keep an eye out for regressions.
