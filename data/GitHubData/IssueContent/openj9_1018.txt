Given that all the low level support on RI was removed, RI isn't going to work for openj9.
In such case, it should be feasible to turn off jit_runtimeInstrumentation and port_runtimeInstrumentation in specs on zOS.

However, the compilation result indicates it fails with the following error in JIT after turning off these two flags:
CCN0793(I) Compilation failed for file openj9/runtime/compiler/../compiler/trj9/z/codegen/J9TreeEvaluator.cpp.  Object file not created.

It was compiled with the changes at https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/pull/903

We are not sure what's going to happen at runtime if the JIT tries to use it
