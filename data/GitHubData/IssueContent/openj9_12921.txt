For diagnostic purposes it would be useful to determine (from a coredump) whether a compilation was performed remotely (by the JITServer) or local. A single bit is sufficient for this task.
This bit could be added to the persistentJittedBodyInfo or MethodMetaData. Since a small number of jitted bodies do not have a persistentJittedBodyInfo, it's probably better to add this bit to MethodMetaData. This data structure is actually called `J9JITExceptionTable` in the VM and has a "flags" field.

We could add another flag in there:
