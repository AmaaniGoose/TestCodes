Summary of problem
------------------

maybe this is a duplicated of #7741, but i have more information that may help.

There's a crash when placing a block from the 0.0.5 version of this Minecraft Mod: https://github.com/CD4017BE/ThermokineticEngineering/packages/481819
(Required Dependency: CD4017BE_lib 6.6.0:
https://github.com/CD4017BE/CD4017BE_lib/packages/71046).

it is not present when using the 0.0.4 version of it (with CD4017BE_lib 6.6.0), so maybe in one of the commits between 0.0.4 and 0.0.5 there's the source of the issue.

@tajila hello again, i remember that you commented in #11271 that there was a difference in the crash report if i use `Xshare:off`, well, the same is happening in this case, i think there is a (hard to fix) reason why this issue (#7741) is still open, if that's the case let me know and i will close this issue.

also, sorry for bothering with these issues related to a game, i should not being using a business software to play (i only do it because of the performance improvement), i think this issue is pretty hard to fix so no worries, i don't wan't to be a nuisance more time, i'm so grateful with you and the others who helped me with that issue
