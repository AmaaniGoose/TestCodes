Rather than requiring the getOriginalROMMethod call, tag breakpointed methods in the modifiers and store a pointer to the original ROM method.

For quick access, the allocated memory for the breakpointed method will begin with the back pointer, followed by the copied ROM method.

Access to the unbreakpointed method will be:
```
if (romMethod->modifiers & NewBit) romMethod = *(((J9ROMMethod**)romMethod) - 1);
```
This could be added to the J9_ROM_CLASS_FROM_RAM_CLASS macro with fairly minimal cost, making the explicit getOriginalROMMethod calls unnecessary. If we need to, we could add a "basic" version of the macro to copy the old behaviour, which would be used infrequently.

It would also be easy to add some assertions to the metadata queries to ensure they are not passed the breakpointed ROM method.
