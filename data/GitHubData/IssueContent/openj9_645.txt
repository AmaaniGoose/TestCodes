Currently the compiler supports the following 'reverse' load and store opcodes

```
   ircload,     // reverse load [opposite endian to natural platform endian] of an unsigned 2 byte value
   irsload,     // reverse load [opposite endian to natural platform endian] of a signed 2 byte value
   iruiload,    // reverse load [opposite endian to natural platform endian] of an unsigned 4 byte value
   iriload,     // reverse load [opposite endian to natural platform endian] of a signed 4 byte value
   irulload,    // reverse load [opposite endian to natural platform endian] of an unsigned 8 byte value
   irlload,     // reverse load [opposite endian to natural platform endian] of a signed 8 byte value
   irsstore,    // reverse store [opposite endian to natural platform endian] of a 2 byte value
   iristore,    // reverse store [opposite endian to natural platform endian] of a 4 byte value
   irlstore,    // reverse store [opposite endian to natural platform endian] of a 8 byte value
```

I believe these opcodes are deprecated, and should be removed. They do still have some consumers in the Data Access Accelerator, and so the reversal will need to be expressed with a different more explicit tree.
