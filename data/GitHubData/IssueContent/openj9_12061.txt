This is an odd intermittent (roughly 1 in 3) behaviour on AIX hotspot builds at AdoptOpenJDK built using OpenJ9 bootjdk, which fail to build due to jvmtiGen failing to produce incorrect gensrc, see issue: https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build/issues/2466
Using a jdk15/16 Hotspot bootjdk works fine.
@pshipton how do you want to approach this one as jvmtiGen is Hotspot code? It is basically a XSL XML input->output translate tool using javax.xml.transform.* .
