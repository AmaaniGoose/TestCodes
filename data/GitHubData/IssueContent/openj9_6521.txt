Add:
- `-f`: read commands from a file
- select VMs by main class instead of VMID
- select all VMs if VMID==0

Update help text accordingly:
```
jcmd <vmid | class> <arguments>
...
    <main class>: string used to select processes from the full list; may be a substring of a fully qualified class name
...
    -f <command file>: read command from a file, one command per line
...
      A <vmid> of 0 indicates that the command should be applied to all Java processes. 
```
