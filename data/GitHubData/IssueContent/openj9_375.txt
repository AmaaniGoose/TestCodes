The getBytes implementation in Java 9 may need to allocate a new byte[] array matching the string length when the backing array is longer than the string length. There is an idea of storing the shortened byte array back to the string. While correct this could increase memory footprint, but could also increase throughput of subsequent getBytes calls. This item is to track doing some kind of performance investigation to determine whether updating the String's value field to hold the shortened string increases performance and/or adversely affects memory consumption.
