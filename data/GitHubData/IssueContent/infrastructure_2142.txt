On CentOS/RHEL8, `docker` is provided by the `podman-docker` package. When you try and pull the image we use for building on a system using `podman-docker` you cannot `su` to the jenkins user inside the container as it gives a message "could not open session" (Seen on x64) or `su: cannot open session: Critical error` on (aarch64 seen as part of https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure/issues/2119#issuecomment-821198804) It's not obvious why this is occurring.
