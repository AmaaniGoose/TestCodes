To support vectorization, the entire 16-byte contents of each XMM register must be preserved in the JIT helpers (currently only 64 bits of FPR parameter registers are preserved).

The helpers will be divided as they were on P into method call and non-method call points. At method call points, only 8 bytes of the parameter XMMs will be preserved so the decompiler can see the contents properly. All non-paramteter XMMs will have all 16 bytes preserved.

There is no need to check the vector flag on X as all supported processors support the full-width XMM registers.
