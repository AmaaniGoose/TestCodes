@apete provided some results for running OpenJ9 and HotSpot on some MatrixMultiplicationBenchmarks. We did well on one, poorly on one and inconsistently on one. See the results at [https://ojalgo.blogspot.com/2019/02/quick-test-to-compare-hotspot-and-openj9.html](https://ojalgo.blogspot.com/2019/02/quick-test-to-compare-hotspot-and-openj9.html). The benchmark can be built from the repo linked on the post with a mvn install. To match the run configuration in the report you need to pass `-i 3 -wi 7 -w 10 -r 10 -f 1`. The library and dimensionality are controlled  -p lib= and -p dim= respectively. The poor performance was seen consistently with lib=ACM and inconsistent behavior with lib=EJML.
