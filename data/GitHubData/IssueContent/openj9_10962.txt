If a crash happens in an AOT body, the jitdump should generate an AOT compilation. However, this is not as trivial as it might seem, as there are three scenarios:

- [x] 1. Crash during an AOT compile - https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/pull/10852
- [ ] 2. Crash in an AOT body that was generated in the current JVM instance
- [ ] 3. Crash in an AOT body that was generated in a different JVM instance

Regarding 2, should the jitdump redo the AOT compilation, the AOT load, or both?
Regarding 3, should the jitdump redo the AOT load?
