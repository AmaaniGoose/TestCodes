At the moment the version of bash on new AIX machines (the `test-ibm-` ones) is [causing problems](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues/9369#issuecomment-624634760) when running some of the builds. It's hitting pipe failures. It's currently unclear whether this is `ulimit`-related (I did some quick tests but they were not conclusive) therefore I have backed out the version of bash on the AIX 7.1SP5 machine used for building OpenJ9 to the version that's on the old build machines, as per the final bullet point of https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build/issues/1733#issue-614108892. This is not repeatable in the playbooks so an alternate solution needs to be found, and the machine updated to reflect the solution we put in place if required.
