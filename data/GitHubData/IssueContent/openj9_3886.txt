Once #3883 is merged, tests need to be added to verify the newly-correct behaviour. I'd suggest adding it to the j9vm test suite, which is run in many modes so it will test the interpreter and JIT.

The tests will either need to be jdk9+, or (my preference) be aware of the lax rules in jdk8 and test for them.
