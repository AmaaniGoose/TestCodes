**Describe the bug** Building the mauve suites requires a java explicitly in the `PATH`

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior (or Grinder rerun link): `BUILD_LIST=system make compile`
```
get-source:

BUILD FAILED

```

**Expected behavior** Test suite would be able to use the java from `TEST_JDK_HOME` but it doesn't.

**Additional context** n/a

I suspect this would be fairly simple to change, and I can't see a reason why it would be beneficial to use the system one instead of the one under test for building, so I would suggest that this be changed to invoke `TEST_JDK_HOME/bin/java` (or `jre/bin/java`) instead of relying on the PATH for simplicity.
