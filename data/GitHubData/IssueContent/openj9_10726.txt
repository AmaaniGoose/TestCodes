The snapshot code currently assumes certain data that's dangled off the vmThread is not persistent. Therefore, when the vmthreads are stored into the image, these fields should be reset.

From what I can tell, the fields are:
profilingBufferEnd
profilingBufferCursor
jitExceptionHandlerCache
jitArtifactSearchCache
aotVMwithThreadInfo
jitVMwithThreadInfo
jitPrivateData
