The [LinuxNumaTest](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/test/functional/VM_Test/src/com/ibm/j9/numa/LinuxNumaTest.java) is failing with null pointer exception if its running with balanced gc policy.

```

**Reason :**
The test checks for `1STHEAPREGION` tag in javacore which has the heap address which the program uses to check in `numa_maps` for policy and nodes. In case of balanced gc the javacore doesn't contain the `1STHEAPREGION` line in it so the program is crashing with null pointer exception.

It seems to be like scope of this test is confined to `gencon` policy. As this is a NUMA test, will it be good to extend its scope to work along with balanced gc as well.
