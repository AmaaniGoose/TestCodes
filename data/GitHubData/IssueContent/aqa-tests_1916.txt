**Describe the bug**
The system test times out, with an instance of the SolverTest hogging each of the threads.

With tests chosen at random in that kind of load test, the tests that *don't* overrun are completed quickly, and replaced by another test from the bucket. So, eventually, all of the concurrent threads are held by one of the test types that *does* overrun, which is what's happened here.

**To Reproduce**
[Test_openjdk8_hs_extended.system_s390x_linux #256/UtilLoadTest_0](https://trss.adoptopenjdk.net/output/test?id=5f1a07cc0bec7975aef8ace0)
