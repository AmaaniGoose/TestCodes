I'm opening this issue to start a discussion on defining a policy for how external controls (JVM options, APIs, etc), can be deprecated. For example, before letting https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/12503 get too far along, it would be beneficial for OpenJ9 to have a defined procedure for how deprecation should be handled. This procedure should take into account (at least):

- Current Stakeholders usage
- Overlap period
- Release schedule
- Documentation updates
- Dealing with deprecation because of OMR
- Dealing with deprecation that needs changes to OMR

Once a community approved procedure is defined, issues like https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/12503 can be tackled.
