From @smlambert in #802

@sxa - while this is a fairly old issue, we can either update it with the intermittent failures seen in sanity.openjdk tests or reference in a new issue (& close this one).

In a [recent test run](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/job/Test_openjdk8_hs_sanity.openjdk_arm_linux/109/testReport/), 2 test cases failing out of 1321 run as part of the sanity.openjdk target.
