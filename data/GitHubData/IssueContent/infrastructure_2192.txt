Multiple reasons
- [They are unreliable](https://github.com/adoptium/infrastructure/issues/2087)
- [They are currently running Ubuntu 16.04](https://github.com/adoptium/infrastructure/issues/1986)
- Scaleway have indicated that new image creation will be limited from June 1st
-- **July 1st** will be end of support
-- **August 1st** will block new C1 instance creations completely, and also BLOCK RESTARTS
-- **September 1** = final end of life - IPs will be detached from the instance

Based on the instability of the scaleway systems and our need to regularly restart them this means an effective absolute end date of August 1st - just over two months from the date I'm opening this issue.

I have already been looking at alternate options, but clearly the preferred one is to get the pis at the colocation setup at Nine fully up and running.
