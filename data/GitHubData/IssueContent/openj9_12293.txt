Java -version output

Summary of problem
------------------
The SCC has some powerful verbose options (ie: `verboseAOT`, `verboseIO`, etc) to show what is being loaded, if the AOT methods are being used, etc.  Unfortunately, this info logs to stderr by default and there's no option to log it to a file.

While trying to diagnose a slow JVM issue with a user, it's been harder to share the verbose output as it's intermingled with regular java output.  It would be a big improvement if we could specify where to write the output so it went to a directory or file the user could pick.

Having the ability to tell it to write a file (using a similar name as verbosegclog ie: `verbosegc.%Y%m%d.%H%M%S.%pid.txt`) to a directory the user specifies would be a major improvement in servicability.
