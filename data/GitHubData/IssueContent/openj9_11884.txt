There are several .cpp files that do
```
#if defined (_MSC_VER) && (_MSC_VER < 1900)
#define snprintf _snprintf
#endif
```
This is particularly frustrating because it means that anytime a new `snprintf` is added somewhere, the dev has to remember to add this definition. This should really be put in a single header somewhere that's visible to everyone.
