Hello,

It would be great if OpenJ9 had a command like hotspot has `jstat -gc` which allows retrieving information like heap usage and GC time of a specified process.

For hotspot, I'm using munin plugins linked below to monitor the java processes, unfortunately I'm not able to find a way to do that with OpenJ9.
