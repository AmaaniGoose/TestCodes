The Dockerfile's advertised in the OpenJ9 documentation are only available for Ubuntu. They also only handle building OpenJ9 and not testing. There is another set of Dockerfiles's in https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/tree/master/buildenv/jenkins/docker-slaves which are not well known. These files add support for additional OSes and provide images suitable for running tests as well as building OpenJ9. They are also regularly maintained. This issue is opened to discuss documenting these Dockerfile's.
