Based on experience of at least several developers, building debug JVM and JIT is quite non-trivial. See https://blog.openj9.org/2018/06/05/debugging-openj9-in-docker-with-gdb/ as an example.

We need to make sure there is a simple way to get symbols, line number info, and non-optimized code for both VM and JIT.

This should help all the platforms. Please share your experience and ideas.
