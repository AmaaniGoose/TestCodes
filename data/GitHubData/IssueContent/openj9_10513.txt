My proposal was that `MethodHandleNatives.checkClassBytes` return the classname as a String to avoid partially reparsing the classfile.  The checks in `getClassName` can still be done in java code after renaming the method to something like `validateClassName`.  
```suggestion
			String targetClassName = MethodHandleNatives.checkClassBytes(bytes);
			validateClassName(targetClassName, bytes);
```
