Currently we run commands by hand based on what the playbook would execute. We are working with Adopt (AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure#562, https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure/issues/553 etc) to improve the robustness and quality of the playbooks so we can build our confidence in them. Once they are "ready" we will run them on a schedule (weekly?). We also need an Ansible tower (AWX) installation in order to run the playbooks in this manner.
