I find references to the environment variable IBM_JAVA_COMMAND_LINE in OpenJ9 debugtools/DDR_VM, the openj9.dtfj module, rasdump/javadump.cpp, but OpenJ9 does not set this environment variable. I believe for IBM Java the IBM Java launcher would set it to the command line options specified. Since its not set for OpenJ9, the RAS code may not provide these command line details as intended.
