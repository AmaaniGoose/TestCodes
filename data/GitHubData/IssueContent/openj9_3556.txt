Unsafe atomic calls should be transformed into atomic intrinsics, which takes a memory address whose content is to be updated.

For arraylets, a spinechk tree is needed before the call to atomic intrinsics to get the actual address.

UnsafeFastPath and J9RecognizedCallTransformer both need the change.
