When running on a 64 bit OS the JVM will crash with a gpf on a non-aligned address:

```
1XHEXCPCODE    J9Generic_Signal_Number: 00000008
1XHEXCPCODE    Signal_Number: 00000007
1XHEXCPCODE    Error_Value: 00000000
1XHEXCPCODE    Signal_Code: 00000001
1XHEXCPCODE    Handler1: F6421D38
1XHEXCPCODE    Handler2: F6364D4C
1XHEXCPCODE    InaccessibleAddress: F65B2015
```
The crash can be avoided by using -Xjit:disableInterpreterProfiling

NB Some kernels have a trap handler that emulates the un-aligned memory accesses. This avoids the crash but presumably has a significant performance impact.
