I propose we stop using `.c` files in OpenJ9 in favour of `.cpp` files. I am not proposing an actual language shift - most files would be wrapped in `extern "C"` rather than making them into classes. The advantages are:

- inline variable declarations on every platform
- inline functions are much more flexible and readable than preprocessor macros

Conversion can take place one file at a time. The majority of the work will be adding casts because C++ does not allow implicit conversion to/from `void*`.

Any new files should be `.cpp`.
