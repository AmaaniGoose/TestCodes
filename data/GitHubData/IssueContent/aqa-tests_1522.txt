This issue builds upon AQA v1.0 (https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/965)

Features to be included in the next drop of AQA (targeted for 3Q 2020):

- AQA BoM https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/1169
    - add SHA.txt to releases repo
    - include link to 'exec summary' of test results and excludes as part of releases artifact
- updated external test targets to be included (related: https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/1109)
- perf targets move from functional set to 'compare to previous release' bar (related: https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/1505)
- initial release to release comparison of perf test targets for LTS releases on xlinux & mac (done manually at first as dependent on some additional work to be done in TRSS) 
- triage and include extended.openjdk target 

Also need to decide if we should include a 'badge' of successful completion on the website, or if BoM in releases repo is sufficient reporting.
