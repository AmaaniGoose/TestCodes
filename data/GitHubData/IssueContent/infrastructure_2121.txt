With the latest QPC run, all platforms have failed to some degree. 4 have failed due calling `buildJDK.sh` in an incorrect way (incorrect as of #1962 ). 

The `risc-v` platform is still blocked by #1483 

And the `arm32` platform seems to be running out of space during the playbook execution.
