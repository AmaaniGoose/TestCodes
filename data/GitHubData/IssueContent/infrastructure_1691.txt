More than half of jdk_jdi tests failed with Dragonwell jdk8 on packet boxes. Tests passed on other boxes. Also test build took 4 hours compared 40 mins on other boxes. Test builds with hotspot|openj9 on packet boxes also take three times longer than on other boxes without behaviour difference. That is test results are consistent running on packet or other boxes.

Not sure what's the difference between packet boxes with other except for performance?
