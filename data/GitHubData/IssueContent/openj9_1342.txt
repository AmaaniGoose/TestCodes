The OpenJ9 build for Java 8 shows significant activity calling libzip.so getEntry when running the DayTrader3 benchmark. It looks like the findResourceImpl will cache the ZipFile/JarFile object, but repeated requests for the same resource will cause the zip file to be read repeatedly. Given the cost of the native call and the synchronization required to access the ZipFile there would seem to be a good opportunity here to improve the caching behaviour of the class loaders.
