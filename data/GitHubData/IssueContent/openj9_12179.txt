Vector registers need to be preserved like it is being done in PowerPC.

A few clarifications:
- There are 32 VRs, with 16-bytes long, the alignment required for preserving them is 16-bytes in AArch64.
- All the VRs overlap with the FPRs.
- For load/store instructions, `vldrimmq` & `vstrimmq` are used respectively.
