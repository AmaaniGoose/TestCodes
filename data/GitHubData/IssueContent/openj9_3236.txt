Currently Attach API uses world-writable files for certain operations such synchronization.  The files in question contain no content but must be writable for locking to succeed.  World-writable files associated with an application may be prohibited by certain standards such as https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Documents_and_Guidance/view_td.cfm?td_id=333.

To conform, the attach API can use a specific common directory without world permissions, provided all applications using that directory using that directory are owned by the same group or user.

In that case, the attach API should create files and directories without world, or possibly group, permissions.

This issue adds an option, specified via a system property, to remove world or world+group permissions from files, in the same fashion as `umask`.

`com.ibm.tools.attach.permissions=[owner|owner+group|all]`

`owner+group` removes world permissions, `owner` removes group and world permissions.  The default is `all` which leaves permissions as currently coded. The attach API system checks the permissions of existing files and will not enable attachAPI if the permissions are broader than specified.

This has no effect on Windows, where all files are accessible by the owner only.
