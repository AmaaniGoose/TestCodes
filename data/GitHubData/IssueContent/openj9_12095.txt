`vmThread->tempSlot` is used in multiple places and for different purposes. More uses of this field has been introduced recently in #10617 and #12034, for example. However, there is currently no unified documentation listing the use of this overloaded field, increasing the risk of introducing changes that cause an overwrite that results unexpected outcomes. The purpose of this issue is to track the work around documenting the uses of this field, similar to how the overloaded J9Method.extra field is documented in #12045. According to a [review comment](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/pull/12034#discussion_r584793526) in #12034, the documentation should answer the following:
1. What are all the uses of this field?
2. How can I be sure that the value I store here will not be overwritten by some other piece of code which wants to use this same field?
