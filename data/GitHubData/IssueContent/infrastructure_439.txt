Currently we have places in our ansible scripts that are [pulling from ci.adoptopenjdk.net](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure/blob/master/ansible/playbooks/AdoptOpenJDK_Unix_Playbook/roles/freemarker/tasks/main.yml) -  we need to decide if this is a sensible approach going forward or if we should host them somewhere else. Options?

- Keep them as-is on ci.adoptopenjdk.net (`~jenkins/.jenkins/userContent`)
- Keep them in github (Maybe a branch of openjdk-infrastructure?)
- Keep them on the AWX server since we'll be using that in order to deploy our machines, so it needs to be alive :-) (NOTE: Some packages used by the AIX playbooks are there)
- Store them on a custom server that we use for storing artefacts
- Anything else?

The following work items will be related to this:
