https://github.com/eclipse/omr/pull/3242 is created to fix a crash in InvariantArgumentPreexistence when the callee method's class type doesn't match the propagated argument type.  However, in some cases, it could be more optimal if inliner can stop inlining the callsite on a dead path in the first place. Currently, ECS (estimate code size) is able to filter out the incompatible callsite when peeking is triggered. We should add similar logic in actual inlining as well in case peeking is not triggered in ECS and a dead callsite target is chosen to be inlined.
