Pulling this comment out into a new issue as the basis for a plan on how to handle backports for the interim release proposal.

Will close this issue if the proposal fails to gain acceptance.

> This sounds great idealogically do you have any ideas on how we would implement this practically to keep the overhead low? Perhaps some kind of label and a business item in the weekly meeting to review the list and change the label to confirm a backport vs remove the label?

Labels would work pretty good for this.  There's already a `backport:candidate` label that could be added when a PR is merged in `master`.  Once a backport is agreed on, we could add a `backport:accepted`, and maybe a `backport:complete` label after the backport is merged?  And maybe a `backport:rejected` label for cases where we decided not to backport.

There should be a fairly low cost workflow that can be implemented with labels and maybe if we want to get really fancy, a new `backports` project kanban board.
