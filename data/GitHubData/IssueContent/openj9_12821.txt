The following failed test seems to have produced an archive containing only the system core:

From the test output however we can see that in addition to `core.20210602.043837.42158.0001.dmp` several other dumps (such as the jitdump) were generated which are needed for investigation here.

@llxia could we take a peek and see what is preventing us from saving all the generated dumps?
