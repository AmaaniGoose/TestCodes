I am having an issue where a process running with
- shared classes
- xtune:virtualized
- aot enabled

if there aren't cached classes yet, the app will start normally and then as it becomes idle few seconds later, lag the server to death with AOT compilation requests (most likely), then about 2-3 minutes later it's back to normal and the app is responsive again.
The behaviour seems the same with both jitserver client enabled and disabled...

Is this expected behaviour? And is compiler thread at least set to be lower priority than the app threads?
