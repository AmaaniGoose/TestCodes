The implementation of j/l/String.split has fast paths for non-regex string patterns. Part of accessing the 'fast path' is a safety check of the split pattern for regex characters. In cases where the pattern string is a known object we should be able to get rid of this safety check at compile-time by validating the constant string against the constant array in the string class. @liqunl is already working on handling constant arrays for VarHandles and will probably have a look at this once that infrastructure is available in the JIT to provide a performance boost.
