### OpenJ9 does not generate sufficient JVMTI sampling object allocation events when the sampling interval is set to zero  ###

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not set the sampler
	at MyPackage.HeapMonitor.sampleEverything(HeapMonitor.java:187)
	at MyPackage.HeapMonitorVMEventsTest.main(HeapMonitorVMEventsTest.java:100)
```

Notes:
-------

The failed test code snippet is in [1]. This test sets the sampling interval to `0`, then attempts to allocate `400` integer arrays `int[1000]`, and expects `400` sampling events which is considered as PASS. Repeat this `10` times until a pass, otherwise a failure. 
`OpenJ9` seems only generate sampling events `12 - 38` for  such `400` array allocation, which is quite far from the number of events required.

I built a standalone testcase [TestSampleEverything.zip](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/files/3258730/TestSampleEverything.zip) without `JVMTI` agent, this issue  can be demonstrated via following:
```
java -Xgc:allocationSamplingGranularity=1 -Xtrace:print={j9mm.394-395} -jar TestSampleEverything.zip 2>&1 | grep elements=1000 | wc -l
```
The expected number of trace output for `object size=4008; number of elements=1000` is close to `10 * 400`, i.e., `4000`, but usually just got below `400`.
