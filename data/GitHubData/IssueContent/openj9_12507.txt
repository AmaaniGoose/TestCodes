The compiler maintains a state machine to represent various execution states:
```
enum JitStates {
   UNDEFINED_STATE = 0,
   IDLE_STATE,
   STARTUP_STATE,
   RAMPUP_STATE,
   STEADY_STATE,
   DEEPSTEADY_STATE,
};
```
The control logic will vary depending on what state the JIT thinks the execution is in. Therefore, the states and what they represent should be documented.
