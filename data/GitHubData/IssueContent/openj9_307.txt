Current test project names in OpenJ9 are not standardized. We would like to rename test project names by following the rules below:
- all test project are named with lower-case with underscore
- change TestExample to example
- change OpenJDK_Playlist to openjdk_regression
- group projects by category (i.e., SVT_LoadTest and SVT_Modularity should be under svt)
- avoid repeating word "test" in project name if possible
