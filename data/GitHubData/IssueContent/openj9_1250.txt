Relates to #1221 - we should assess the value of these DDR tests (from com/ibm/j9ddr/tools).  If they are deemed useful, the tests should be migrated to the test dir (and cleaned up to be testng format, package renamed, using logger, etc).

We have other DDR tests that will be added to the OpenJ9 project, so this assessment should look at whether there is duplication and drop anything that is duplicate testing.
