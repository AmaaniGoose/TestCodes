Currently, if a class (lets say `Foo`) has a class chain stored in the SCC, if we try to remember `Foo`'s parent (lets say `Bar`), we do not reuse part of `Foo`'s class chain, even though `Bar`'s class chain is fundamentally a subset of `Foo`'s class chain. Instead, we store `Bar`'s own class chain separately.

By changing the way class chains are structured in the SCC to allow such reuse, we not only save space in the SCC, but also enforce the invariant that a parent class must succeed being remembered in the SCC if its child succeeded (thereby preventing bugs such as https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues/4751).
