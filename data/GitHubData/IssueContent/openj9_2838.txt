When running in containers with CPU quota set, performance of the application may be adversely affected if CPU frequency governor is set to "powersave".

As an example, compare application running on 4 CPUs with 100% quota vs running it on 8 CPUs with 50% quota. If the CPU frequency governor is set to "powersave", performance in latter case is very poor even though the application has 4 "effective" cpus.

We have observed this during internal testing on DayTrader 3. We ran DayTrader 3 with following cases (Frequency Governor - powersave(default)):

    - 4 cpus, 100% quota
    - 8 cpus, 50% quota

Throughput comparison for the above cases:

	Case 			Throughput
	4Cpu100Quota 		9248.22
	8Cpu50Quota 		7771.04

We also asked about this on Ubuntu forum here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1007656/behavior-of-powersave-freq-governor-when-cpu-quota-is-set/1007731#1007731

When we came to know that its due to the powersave frequency governor. we ran again with performance frequency governor and saw the difference in throughput

	Case 			Throughput
	4Cpu100Quota 		8255.2
	8Cpu50Quota 		8355.69


It appears this drop in performance is expected with "powersave" governor. If thats the case then it would be useful to capture the CPU frequency governor being used in javacore which can be helpful in dealing with performance problems.

The Javacore `CPU information section` could be delivering this extended feature and might look something like :
