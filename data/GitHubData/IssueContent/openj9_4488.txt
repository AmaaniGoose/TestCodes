Problem: When jlinking, I noticed the resulting directories have distinctly different sizes.

This is a footprint bug, as one of jlinking's primary advantages is disk size, and this negates part of that advantage.

Details: Dinakar discovered that the main difference (on Linux at least) is in the properties and dat files.

Example:

```jlink --add-modules java.base --output C:\output_folder```

Hotspot 11 result on Windows: 38.0mb
OpenJ9 11 result on Windows: 50.6mb

Hotspot 11 result on Linux: 46.8mb
OpenJ9 11 result on Linux: 52.6mb
