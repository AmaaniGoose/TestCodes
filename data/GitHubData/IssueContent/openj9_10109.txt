When trying to build openj9 jdk11 on a Windows 2012 Server machine following the instructions here: https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/doc/build-instructions/Build_Instructions_V11.md, the build failed with many messages similar to:
```
if not exist "C:\Users\Administrator\git\openj9-openjdk-jdk11\build\windows-x86_64-normal-server-release\vm\" mkdir "C:\Users\Administrator\git\openj9-openjdk-jdk11\build\windows-x86_64-normal-server-release\vm\"
The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.^M

make[5]: *** [makefile:70: default] Error 2
```
It turned out the issue was due to cygwin 3.1.5 (the version installed by default since 1st June 2020) not passing the arguments to a process started with `cmd /c` correctly.  

The 'fix' was to reinstall cygwin specifying the versions for cygwin and cygwin-devel packages to be 3.1.4.  I was not successful in simply uninstalling and reinstalling those two packages - I had to completely remove cygwin (google search or read the cygwin FAQ for how to do that) and reinstall.

Raising this issue in case in case it helps anyone encountering the same build failure.
