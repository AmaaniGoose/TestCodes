Jenkins Compress build log plugin
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Compress+Build+Log+Plugin

Issue:
```
Pipeline Compatibility
From version 1.1, the Compress Build Log Plugin supports compressing full pipeline build logs, but not the per-step build logs stored separately.
```

What this means, The overall log is essentially duplicated/separated into each step as a separate numbered log file. The overall log which has all the output will be replaced with a `gz` compressed version but each step will not be compressed. I have tried removing the individual step logs. This removes the steps from the blue ocean view. I have also tried gzipping the numbered logs but this is the same result as deleting them.
