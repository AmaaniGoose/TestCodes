The OMR project has been implementing Direct Dump Reader (DDR) support on top of libdwarf.  

OpenJ9 needs to enable DDR support and ensure that the functionality in the OMR project is sufficient to provide the rich debug & introspection capabilities J9 has historically supported.

OpenJ9 issues are difficult to debug without this support.
