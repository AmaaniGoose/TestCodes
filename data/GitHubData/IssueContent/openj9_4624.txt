When the JIT is built under `DEBUG` mode by specifying `BUILD_CONFIG=DEBUG` during the make process the following assertion was seen on Linux on Z compressedrefs running the DayTrader 7 benchmark:

For this one I have the core file saved as well as a JIT dump which I will attach to this issue. The core file is unfortunately too large to attach, but I can provide it. This issue is intermittent and I am not sure I will be able to reproduce, but I can try if we need more tracing.

Here is the full backtrace from the core:
