The addition or removal of methods which do not affect the shape of the vTable should be allowed in fast HCR.

Methods which never appear in the vTable are:

- private instance methods
- static methods

Methods which do not need to appear in the vTable but currently do:

- final instance methods which do not override

New final methods should follow the invokeprivate path. This is likely a matter of removing their vTable modifier and modifying the restrictions on which methods can use invokeprivate during resolution.
