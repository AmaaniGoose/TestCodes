When a qtype classref is resolved it must be a VT. When a Ltype classref or non-signature classref is resolved it must not be a VT, an error must be thrown in this case. At time of writing this issue it is currently unknown what kind of error will be thrown.

In addition, we need to verify at classload that all fieldrefs with Qsignatures are VTs. It is uncertain whether we will need to verify that all fieldrefs with L signatures are not VTs. 

Tests must also be added to verify this behaviour
