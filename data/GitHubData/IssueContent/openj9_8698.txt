There's a comment about "optimizing" with wider data types - this is not an optimization, it's a requirement. All array accesses must be atomic wrt the element size. This is particularly important for object arrays, where non-slot copies will result in potentially "torn" object pointers, which will cause random crashes in the VM/GC/JIT code.
