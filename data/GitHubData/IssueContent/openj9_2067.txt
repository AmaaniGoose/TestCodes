The code in optinfo.c doesn't handle decompression of entries properly in the most general case (where the PC and line-number offsets are large). The line at [1]:
```c
lineNumberOffset = 0xFFFF & lineNumberOffset;
```
does nothing because the value was already limited to 16 bits; so it doesn't do as the comment says: 'set the sign bit to 1'. Perhaps what was intended was:
```c
lineNumberOffset |= 0xFFFF0000;
```
Whatever the outcome, the behavior should be mirrored in [2].
