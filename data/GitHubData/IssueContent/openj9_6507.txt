Currently `varHandleMethodTypeTableEntryAddress` is made into a remote call to the client, and client sends back the final result to the server. We could potentially have the server do all the calculations and eliminate the remote call.

Also we could make `varHandleMethodTypeTableEntryAddress` and `isUnresolvedVarHandleMethodTypeTableEntry` into one remote call instead of two.
May also apply to other methods like `callSiteTableEntryAddress` and `isUnresolvedCallSiteTableEntry` for example.
