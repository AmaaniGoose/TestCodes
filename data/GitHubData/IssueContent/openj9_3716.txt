The annotation @sun.misc.Contended (@jdk.internal.vm.annotation.Contended in Java 9+) is supported on OpenJDK to automatically insert padding between an object header and its fields (class level annotation) or around individual fields (field level annotation).

Currently, only the class level @Contended annotation has the desired effect under OpenJ9, while field level usage is a noop.
