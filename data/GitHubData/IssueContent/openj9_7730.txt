OMR mirrored all of the J9 defines (OMR_x rather than J9VM_x) when it was created, so now we have two versions of a lot of defines, which leads to porting errors, etc.

Wherever an identical OMR define exists, the J9 code should use it, and the J9VM define should be permanently deleted to prevent future uses.
