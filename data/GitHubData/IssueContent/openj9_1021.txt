The JIT compiler can currently built in 3 major configurations: debug, assertions, or production (names subject to revision). Capturing which of these configurations the JVM is running with in the -version output can be a significant aid to debugging performance and functional problems. There was a discussion on the OpenJ9 Slack general channel on 25 January 2018 discussing this topic. I believe the conclusion was that where the current version string has JIT enabled or JIT disabled we would like to enhance this to be more expressive. A suggestion of JIT enabled, JIT assertions, JIT debug, or JIT disabled  was proposed and, I believe, achieved consensus acceptance by those participating in the discussion (@pshipton @DanHeidinga @mstoodle @andrewcraik). There may be further revisions, but this is to track the aspiration to capture this information, the discussion of the format, and any implementation required.
