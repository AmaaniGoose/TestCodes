While building TensorFlow from source on s390x Ubuntu 16.04 with AdoptJDK facing below error:

```
bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package  
.
.
.
ERROR: /root/tensorflow/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/BUILD:117:1: no such package '@nasm//': java.io.IOException: block overrun and referenced by '//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:licenses'
ERROR: Analysis of target '//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package' failed; build aborted: no such package '@nasm//': java.io.IOException: block overrun
INFO: Elapsed time: 14.837s
FAILED: Build did NOT complete successfully (137 packages loaded)
    currently loading: tensorflow/core/kernels ... (2 packages)
```
It seems this is related to AdoptOpenJDK on s390x. I have verified that the build with OpenJDK 8 works.
Further, verified the nasm file is valid. More discussion can be found here:

Tried with `jdk8u162-b12_openj9-0.8.0` as well as` jdk8u181-b13_openj9-0.9.0`

Could someone please help in resolving the issue?
