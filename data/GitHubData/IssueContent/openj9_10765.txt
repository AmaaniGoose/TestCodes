Currently, the Power codegen has code for inlining the `Unsafe.setMemory` method by using the `setmemoryEvaluator` function from OMR. However, this function seems to be practically identical to the behaviour of the `arrayset` opcode. Implementing a transformation as part of `J9RecognizedCallTransformer` to use `arrayset` to implement this method would not only allow this duplicate code to be removed, but would also allow X and Z to benefit from this as well, as they also implement the `arrayset` opcode.
