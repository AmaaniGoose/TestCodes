### Proposed Changes

I would request to install Software Testing Automation Framework (STAF) on 2 perf machines. This would allow us to run benchmarks such as Open Liberty with DayTrader that require 2 machines to communicate with each other. Thanks!

Currently, we just have 2 machines labelled with `ci.role.perf`: https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/label/ci.role.perf/

We need to install STAF on those 2 machines. My team has been using STAF for quite sometime so I would be happy to help in setting it up.

### Justification

Please refer to this prerequisite for perf testing: https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/1138
