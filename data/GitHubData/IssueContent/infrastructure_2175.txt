jdk17 openjdk tests have introduced a dependency on `hostname` and `which`, which are missing from some test machines.

So far the failures I've seen have been on docker machines:
```
test-docker-fedora33-armv8l-2
test-docker-fedora33-x64-3
```
Affected test cases:
TEST: sun/net/www/protocol/https/HttpsURLConnection/PostThruProxyWithAuth.java (needs `hostname`)
TEST: java/nio/file/attribute/BasicFileAttributeView/UnixSocketFile.java (needs `which`)
