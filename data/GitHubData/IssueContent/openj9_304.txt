`Unsafe.ensureClassInitialized()` is a jni method to initialize a class if it hasn't been initialized. Calling to this method will always land in the VM regardless of the class' initialization status. Since a class will only need initialization once, one potential optimization is to emit a check on the initialization status of the class in the jit and skip the call to `Unsafe.ensureClassInitialized()` if it has been initialized. This optimization might not help the performance since we don't expect it to be called very often during steady state, but it might help start up.
Investigations on some benchmarks such as daytrader and spark are also needed.
