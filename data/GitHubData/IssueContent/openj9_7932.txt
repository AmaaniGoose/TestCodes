For source files which are not under the source directory of the current project (ie referencing openj9 source files from omr, or vice versa).  CMake encodes the full path in the object name. This is an issue on windows as we currently use the openjdk `fixpath`  program to launch the compiler. Fixpath indiscriminately replaces `/cygdrive/X/` with `X:/`, even if it appears in the middle of a string. This yields an invalid path, since it has a `:` in the middle of it.

However if the source tree path is long enough, the full path to the object becomes very long, and in order to avoid `PATH_MAX`, cmake will abbreviate the path by replacing the common directory ie `/cygdrive/c/path/to/jdk` by its string hash, thus removing the `/cygdrive/c` meaning we no longer have an valid path
