Hi all, 
deployment technologies for applications and runtimes have progressed a lot. Kubernetes(K8s) and OpenShift(OCP) based deployments are now common. Do you think, we should add these deployment options to  OpenJ9? With JIT Server technology now being available - easy deployment to K8s and OCP allow better consumability for OpenJ9 technologies in various hybrid cloud platforms.

This can include
 - Helm Chart for K8s 
 - Operator for OpenShift4+
 - And various platform support in them.

There may be support for other platforms we have to add but K8s powering most hybrid cloud platforms I think it helps to start from there and OpenShift4 is a natural option as well being an open Hybrid Cloud platform.

Please refer to the User Story and Roadmap:
