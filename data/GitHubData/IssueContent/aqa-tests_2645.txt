Related to the now stale pull request for https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/pull/1833, this enhancement issue is to add support for using Docker images from other registries (besides where we currently pull from... the AdoptOpenJDK Docker repo).

This is not urgent, but wanted to create it so we do not lose the request, as we will close the stale PR that has no associated issue.
