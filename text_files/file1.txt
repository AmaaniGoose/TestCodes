As an example of this type of testing, we have added scala tests: https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/tree/master/thirdparty_containers/scala



We have derby and solr_lucene tests running in the same "dockerized" way, so we should also add those test sub-folders.



Once we have those 3 examples of 3rd party application tests added, we should consider the list of other applications we would like to add and prioritize them (eclipse, cassandra, etc).  It will also be good to engage with these communities so that they are aware that we will be running their community test suites against the different flavours of JVM at AdoptOpenJDK (openjdk8, openjdk9, openjdk+openj9...).



Here is a list of potential ones to add, not in any priority order:

Also, this [Testing Java link](https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-992137) and this [Quality Outreach link](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/quality/Quality+Outreach) relates to this effort (engaging with Java projects, unblocking them if they have issues)...



Consider new tests via external_custom test target.

Consider startup tests for quick smoke test of each application.
